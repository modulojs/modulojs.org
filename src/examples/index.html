    <h1>Advanced Usage</h1>

    <p><strong>Experimental:</strong> The following demos show off some of the
    cool and unusual things you can get Modulo to do! However, they are
    designated "experimental" either because they might be using internal APIs
    that could change before the Modulo <em>beta</em>, use another version of
    Modulo and haven't been updated yet, or require a bit more polish before
    they become fully recommended.</p>
