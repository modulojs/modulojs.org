In this quick tutorial, I'll show how to create a `StateActions` [Component
Part](https://modulojs.org/docs/cparts/) which is a great way to create
versatile, common, re-usable actions across all your [Modulo JS
components](https://modulojs.org/tutorial/ramping-up/part1.html). The end
result is already useful, and also gives you a useful structure to continue
writing more  actions. Best of all, the actions you define are _generic_,
meaning they can be applied to future components regardless of what specific
state variables they are using.




So, let's get down to business!

## Step 1 - Creating a CPart

Creating and registering a CPart:

```javascript
class StateActions {
    // TODO ...
}

modulo.register('cpart', StateActions);
```

To include this CPart in a Modulo project (at the top level, e.g. your `/static/index.html`):

```html
<Configuration -src="./js/StateActions.js"></Configuration>
```


## Step 2 - Using in a Component


Adding a method, and then using the CPart and attaching it as a click function:


```javascript
class StateActions {
    setToThree(key, value) {
        this.element.cparts.state.data.num = 3;
    }
}

modulo.register('cpart', StateActions);
```

And how to use in your Component definitions:


```html
<Template>
  <button @click:=stateactions.setToThree>Num: {{ state.num }}</button>
</Template>
<State
  num:=1
></State>
<!-- Here is where we actually include the State Actions: -->
<StateActions></StateActions>
```


## Step 3 - Making generic

The most complicated step is next: Transforming the specific method into a generic action. We'll use the `this.attrs` so that the user of our generic CPart can specify which State variables they wish to modify. Now, instead of having to hardcode the value, let's make it more configurable, so it can be a "generic" action that can apply to _any value_:

```javascript
class StateActions {
    initializedCallback() {
        const results = {};
        // Loop through all configuration attributes:
        for (let [ key, methodName ] of Object.entries(this.attrs)) {
            results[key] = this.set.bind(this, key); // Bind "set" method with "key", so it remembers this
        }
        return results;
    }
    set(key, value) {
        this.element.cparts.state.data[key] = value;
        // "Propagate" is added so bound forms, components, etc get rerendered
        this.element.cparts.state.propagate(key, value);
    }
}

modulo.register('cpart', StateActions);
```

And to use:

```html
<Template>
  <button @click:=stateactions.num payload:=3>Num: {{ state.num }}</button>
</Template>
<State
  num:=1
></State>
<StateActions
  num
></StateActions>
```

## Step 4 - Adding another generic method

Cleaning up and final results with a default value, and adding "push" generic action:

```javascript
class StateActions {
    initializedCallback() {
        const results = {};
        for (let [ key, methodName ] of Object.entries(this.attrs)) {
            methodName = methodName || 'set'; // Default to set
            results[key] = this[methodName].bind(this, key);
        }
        return results;
    }
    set(key, value) {
        this.element.cparts.state.data[key] = value;
        this.element.cparts.state.propagate(key, value);
    }
    push(key, value) {
        const arr = this.element.cparts.state.data[key];
        arr.push(value);
        this.element.cparts.state.propagate(key, arr);
    }
}

modulo.register('cpart', StateActions);
```


```html
<Template>
  <button @click:=stateactions.num payload=3>Num: {{ state.num }}</button>
  <button @click:=stateactions.list payload="bread">Add to list: {{ state.list }}</button>
</Template>
<State
  num:=1
  list:=[]
></State>
<StateActions
  num
  list=push
></StateActions>
```

Hopefully this tutorial will help you add re-usable JavaScript actions to your next Modulo JS project. If you found this interesting and are new to [Modulo JS](https://modulojs.org/), then consider taking [the interactive tutorial](https://modulojs.org/tutorial/ramping-up/), or just playing around with some [examples](https://modulojs.org/examples/) to get a better idea of what you can do with this mighty little 2000 line framework. Either way, feel free to follow me here for more tutorials like this. Thanks for reading!
