Hey everyone! Are you excited about anything this beautiful Spring Friday? I am excited to be back to writing another tutorial after a month-long hiatus... and also excited to make it about one of my favorite video games of all time: PokÃ©mon! As always, if you have an idea for a next topic, be sure to let me know in the comments!

## "HTML-only, no JS!" âœ¨ðŸª„

In previous tutorials, I focused more on design: I showed how to make a simple [gradient picker](https://dev.to/michaelpb/the-2000-line-framework-challenge-making-a-gradient-picker-tool-in-13-lines-of-pure-html-code-1-extra-file-no-node-or-js-2jb1), or [a more flashy 3D extruded text art effect](https://dev.to/michaelpb/creating-a-3d-extruded-text-word-art-picker-in-only-30-lines-of-pure-html-web-component-code-1-extra-file-3b86), all written in pure HTML and templating, leaving the JS heavy-lifting to the framework.

Today's tutorial takes a very different approach: It shows how you can quickly display public "web APIs" (that is, public data sets or web services) with just a few lines of code.

## How to use the PokÃ©API

This tutorial is 100% thanks to [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/), which is a fun, fan-maintained database and API for retrieval of PokÃ©mon franchise information and media. For example, this link provides info in JSON format for my favorite pink puff: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/jigglypuff


## The final result

**Try it out now, in less than 30 seconds:** ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ Wanna skip ahead? Scroll to the end and copy the ~30 lines of HTML code into any local HTML file, and then open it in your browser. Modulo is a single-file framework with no dependencies and even runs embedded in local HTML files, so it's really that easy!


## Starting with a basic H1 and StaticData

Let's start with something super basic: Let's get info from the API. We can start with `<Template>` and `<StaticData>`:

```django
<Template>
   <h1>{{ staticdata.name|capfirst }} Party!</h1>
</Template>
<StaticData
  -src="https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/jigglypuff"
></StaticData>
```

In this snippet, we have a very simple, one-line `<Template>` that shows the `name` property of the returned PokÃ©API. We apply the `|capfirst` filter to capitalize it (it is all-lowercase by default). The `StaticData` supports JSON (among other formats) out of the box, which means all it needs is the URL to the API and it will integrate it into your component. If the `StaticData` concept is giving you conceptual trouble, try this tutorial [on integrating the GitHub API](https://dev.to/michaelpb/the-2000-line-framework-challenge-how-to-template-json-or-apis-in-3-lines-of-component-code-1-extra-file-no-npm-needed-3771), or the play around with the interactive examples in [Part 4](https://modulojs.org/tutorial/ramping-up/part4.html) of the Modulo.js tutorial.


## Looping through generations and the games

We have to write 2 for loops now: One for the generations, and one for the games.

How did I figure this out? I clicked through the results of the API, and deduced that `.sprites`, and specifically `.sprites.versions` has all the "generations" of games in the JSON _Object_ data structure. This is where the data gets tricky, since it's not accessible "at the top level" (like `.name`). We'll need to "drill down" to the right data.

So, nesting the two `for-loops`, we get:

```django
{% for generation, games in staticdata.sprites.versions %}
    {% for game, images in games %}
```

## Showing the `front_default` image in the loop

Finally, we'll need to reference the `front_default` image in an `<img>` tag to display it. See below:


```django
{% for generation, games in staticdata.sprites.versions %}
    {% for game, images in games %}
        <img src="{{ images.front_default }}" class="dancing-image" />
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

The `{% for %}` loop repeats the HTML code contained within. This is how it "duplicates" the `<img src="...">` over and over to show all the images. For more practice on `{% for %}` loops, play around with the [interactive examples in the documentation](https://modulojs.org/docs/templating/tags.html#for).

## Adding the CSS animation

Finally, to wrap this up, we'll need to make 'em dance! I made a "PokeDance" animation, which rocks back and forth, notably making the `transform-origin: bottom center` to make it look like their "center of gravity" is at the bottom (at their feet), as such:

```html
.dancing-image {
    transform-origin: bottom center;
    animation: PokeDance 3s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
    width: 200px;
}
@keyframes PokeDance {
   20% { transform: rotate(15deg); }	
   40% { transform: rotate(-10deg); }
   60% { transform: rotate(5deg); }	
   80% { transform: rotate(-5deg); }	
  100% { transform: rotate(10deg); }
}
```


## `<x-PokeParty>` - Embeddable snippet

Combining it all, and adding a few final tweaks (the `title` on the image, and a tweak of adding `-auto-isolate:=false` to prevent `PokeDance` animation from being modified), we get the following:

```django
<template Modulo>
    <Component name="PokeParty">
        <Template>
            <h1>{{ staticdata.name|capfirst }} Party!</h1>
            {% for generation, games in staticdata.sprites.versions %}
                {% for game, images in games %}
                    <img class="dancing-image"
                        title="{{ generation }}: {{ game }}"
                        src="{{ images.front_default }}" />
                {% endfor %}
            {% endfor %}
        </Template>
        <StaticData
            -src="https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/bellsprout"
        ></StaticData>
        <Style -auto-isolate:=false>
            .dancing-image {
                transform-origin: bottom center;
	              animation: PokeDance 3s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
	              width: 200px;
            }
            @keyframes PokeDance {
	             20% { transform: rotate(15deg); }	
	             40% { transform: rotate(-10deg); }
	             60% { transform: rotate(5deg); }	
	             80% { transform: rotate(-5deg); }	
	            100% { transform: rotate(10deg); }
            }
        </Style>
    </Component>
</template>
