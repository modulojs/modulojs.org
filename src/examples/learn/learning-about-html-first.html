In this article, we will look at 1) why [Modulo.js](https://modulojs.org/) aims to be HTML framework first, and 2) how it achieves that.

## Why HTML?

Modulo was developed with several goals in mind. Here are a few of them, in no particular order, with a brief explanation of each:

* Declarative (Coding should feel like configuration)
* Explicit (Middleware is included and referenced explicitly)
* Simple (KISS - Keep it simple, silly!)
* Educational (It should be easy to start small when learning)
* Complexity layers (Complexity should be in layers, with simple tasks requiring knowledge of fewer layers)

HTML checks all those boxes: It's declarative and tends to be explicit, and it is so simple and educational that it is often the first thing taught in coding!

That's why Modulo's goal is to add "complexity layers" on top of that. For example, "non-coders" do declarative programming all the time without knowing it, or at least something conceptually similar enough. For example, changing settings in a web browsers, setting a microwave, programming an electronic music keyboard, or writing an email template. *It's all kinda programming... when you think about it!*

## Let's see the code!


See below how _State_ is created using HTML syntax + Template syntax, and then used to create an interactive gradient picker:

```django
<Template>
    <!-- (snip) -->
    <div style="background: linear-gradient(to right,
              {{ state.from }} {{ state.percent }}%,
              {{ state.to }});"></div>
</Template>
<State
    from="#AABAAA"
    to="#5D655E"
    percent:=50
></State>
```

## How Modulo aims to be HTML-first

Modulo aims to be much more HTML-oriented compared to other web framework. In some ways, you might like to think of it as an HTML framework that happens to be written in JavaScript.


### HTML-first learning

When learning Modulo through the [Ramping Up with
Modulo](https://modulojs.org/tutorial/ramping-up/part1.html), it is HTML-first,
sprinkling in Template syntax and Modulo concepts as needed. Only in the end
does it touch on JavaScript.

### HTML-first syntax

Modulo is HTML-first in that it piggy-backs off of HTML syntax. Component Parts
are declared using HTML tags, within other HTML tags, as opposed to within
JavaScript. It follows HTML syntax and semantics, and does not include a custom
parser, so it can be compatible with the browser's parser. Script tags embed JS
into HTML, instead of the other way around (e.g. JSX in React).


### HTML-first workflow

Thirdly, it is HTML-first in terms of development workflow. A greenfield
Modulo-powered website starts as a static site of HTML and CSS files, created
and edited by hand. As the requirements become more demanding, the vanilla HTML
tags are gradually swapped for Modulo web-components, with templated HTML and
bundled CSS. Only as requirements grow beyond the common use-cases offered by
"canned" CParts does JavaScript come into play.

### HTML-first integration

Finally it is HTML-first in terms of interoperability. Modulo exposes itself as
a extension to vanilla HTML via the Web Components standard. The boilerplate is
as lightweight possible: Typically just ~4 lines (Modulo tag, possibly
including a Library), and you can now integrate your Modulo HTML components
throughout the rest of the HTML. This means it will comfortably integrate with
anything that deals with HTML, e.g. PHP, Django, Rails, and even other frontend
frameworks.
