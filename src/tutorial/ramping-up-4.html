# Shadow & Slots



> **The origin of slots** Slots are a feature of the "shadow DOM", a new-ish
> feature of web browsers. Modulo replicates the same behavior of these
> "shadow" slots, making slots even easier to use without JavaScript.

As we explored in the last section, _components_ are "define once, re-use many
times" bits of code. Often, it's useful for a component to "wrap around" other
HTML, or contain other HTML. For example, a stylized button component might
wrap around text, or a stylish "modal dialog" component would wrap around
paragraphs and other arbitrary HTML content. You can thus imagine the button or
modal in these examples as having "empty spots" or _slots_ where this content
would go. That is to say, the component is a sort of "empty picture frame", and
the web developer using the component would be able to "slide content" into the
frame's empty slot.

_Slots_ allow there to be "empty spots" in your HTML that proceed to get filled
by arbitrary content supplied when your component is used. Adding a slot is as
simple as including a `<slot></slot>` HTML element in your component's
_Template_ definition.

Here's an example that "wraps" a slot inside a div with a CSS class of
"picture-frame":

```html
<div class="picture-frame">
    <slot></slot>
</div>
```

To fill up a _slot_ with HTML content, add the content between the opening and
closing tags of your HTML element. Here's an example that might go with the
above example:

```html
<x-PictureFrame>
    <p>My cat:</p>
    <img src="./cat.jpg" />
</x-PictureFrame>
```

##### Try it now

1.  Resume editing the HTML file you were working on in the previous "TRY IT
NOW" section.
2.  Time to add a slot! Let's make our "HelloWorld" component be ready to have
a customized greeting. Edit your embedded component to look like this:
4.  Now, let's fill the slot! Edit your usage to include text or even other
HTML between your `x-HelloWorld` opening and closing tags:


# Events

Let's review a list of event types, and practice attaching events like click in
order to push items onto an array.

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <p>Items: {{ state.items|join:", " }}</p>
    <button
        @click:=state.items.reverse 
    >Reverse</button>
</Template>
<State
    items:='[ "candy", "bread" ]'
></State>
```
