In this final section of *Building Apps*, we'll talk about _optimizing_ and
_integrating_. In other words, let's make our code go fast, and making it mesh
well our server set-ups!

### Building: Packing it all up

"Building" is a feature of Modulo where it packs up all the components,
JavaScript, and CSS you have loaded on a particular page into single `.js` and
`.css` files, respectively. This single file file, called a _build_, contains
all the code from all your components (including CParts that were split off
using `-src=`).

These "builds" are fully independent: Once the "build" file is included using a
`<script src="...">`, all your components on that page will work, without any
need for including Modulo or your libraries specifically. In other words, this
tag replaces all the boilerplate you have on your page, and you can remove all
the importing-type code (e.g. `<script Modulo>`) from your HTML files,
replacing it only with the single script tag. Not only that, it will also
pre-compile JavaScript code, removing the need for "eval", and reducing file
sizes. This causes the components to load much faster.

Generally, developers create builds before "launching" their site to
"production" (e.g. publishing their site for the world to see), since it
results in the fastest possible loading time. Note that you should only attempt
to edit your original, source files: Builds are only for releasing or
publishing, but not for editing. Never directly edit builds; instead, create
new ones.

### Pre-rendering HTML for instant loading

Even with built JavaScript code, you might notice that there is a "flicker"
effect, where the page remains unstructured and unstyled until all your
components finish rendering their _Templates_. Depending on how complicated
your page is, this could be brief and forgivable, or could take a while and
create a bad user experience. One option is to add a "Spinner" to your page,
that is removed once things are loaded. Another option is to use pre-rendered
HTML.

Modulo can pre-render HTML as well, and output a brand new HTML file that can
be published instead of your original one. A "pre-rendered HTML" file is a
special, processed HTML file which basically "freezes" the result of loading
the page for the first time. You can use this messy, processed HTML file as a
drop-in replacement to your previous HTML page when launching, as it will
already have JavaScript and CSS tags included for your build!

To build a project, we will need to use the _Modulo Command Menu_. The
_console_ is a feature of all web browsers. As a web developer you likely have
used it: It's a panel, hidden by default, where JS, CSS, and other such error
messages are displayed. While most JS frameworks require NPM-based tools to
build, Modulo can be built right from your browser's console, simply clicking
on the `build` commands in the `COMMAND` menu, that is visible in your browser
developer tools console.

Build files will look like: `modulo-build-xx4bz9v4.js`,
`modulo-build-x9f2za71.css`. Note the so-called "hash" (e.g. “xx4bz9v4”): These
unique IDs identify each JS and CSS file that is generated by Modulo. If you
change something in your components, you will cause one (or both) of these
hashes to change, if they end up affecting the component's behavior (`.js`) or
it's appearance (`.css`).

##### Try it now

1.  Open up your HTML file in your browser (e.g. Firefox or Chrome/Chromium).
Do not open your component library HTML files: Be sure to open the file that
_is doing the importing_ and _using the components_, not the file(s) that
contain the component definitions themselves.
2.  Bring up the console: Press `Control+Shift+J` (Linux, Windows) or
`Command+Option+J` (macOS) on your keyboard to open the Console. Alternatively,
you can right-click with your mouse and select "Inspect", and then go to the
_Console_ tab.
3.  _Optional:_ Within the newly opened developer tools, navigate for a moment
to the "Network" tab. Force refresh your browser. You should see a list of
"requests" being sent, including one for each component library that needs
loading. For example, if we named our component library
"./static/my-component-lib.html", we'll see an additional request for this
HTML file. If we had further split our files using "-src=", we'll see even more
requests.
4.  Do you see a Modulo logo (`%`), with the word `COMMANDS`? Click on
`COMMANDS`, and possibly one more time (on Firefox), and you should see a
command menu, containing commands like `build` and `test`. To build, simply
click the "`build`" command.
    
    Note: Look in the upper-right hand of your browser. You might see a
    warning, prompting you about "Allowing multiple downloads". You should
    allow it, otherwise it will block the generated files from being
    downloaded. If you see no warnings about this, then just continue to the
    next step.
    
5.  Your browser should reload, and then offer to download an HTML, CSS, and JS
file, or perhaps offer a way to save them. These are the "build" files, and
contain the contents of all libraries that were loaded on this page, with
underlying JavaScript pre-compiled for speed and security. Save them all
together in some spot.
6.  The HTML "build" is a copy of the HTML page you were working on, with two
important differences:
7.  Difference #1: It's been modified to include the built versions of the CSS
and JS: A link tag to include the CSS file is inserted before the `</head>`,
and a script tag inserted before the `</body>` tag to include the JS file.
8.  Difference #2: It contains the page's _current_ state, e.g., the result of
an initial render. This means that when that HTML page is loaded, it will be
"prerendered", and thus appear to load much faster, and components will render
correctly, even before the JavaScript finishes loading.
9.  Now, open up your "build" file. If all went well, it should look and behave
exactly as before, except load much faster.

_Tip:_ If all went well after building, you should see a link to the command
you just ran. Clicking on the link will refresh the page, causing it to build
again. You can also just hit refresh (Ctrl+R or Command+R) to rebuild. Consider
keeping this window open, or as another tab, and resuming work in another
window. Then, to rebuild, simply switch back to this window, and either click
the button or hit refresh!

**Important: Don't edit your builds!** Built files are disposable. Don't edit
the HTML, JS, or CSS files produced. Instead, continue working on your original
"source" files, and then build again. The purpose of these new "built" files is
to only share them when you are done with your website. These should only be
used when "launching" your site. Your development should continue on the
"source" files.

This can easily trip up beginners: The build "freezes" the component library in
time, and you'll have to run build again if you change anything. A common
mistake is forgetting that you are editing the original `.html` file while
using the built `.js` version, causing much confusion as to why your changes
don't take effect!


# Integrating

This section contains advice on integrating Modulo.js with other frameworks.
This might include backend frameworks or other frontend frameworks.

It also talks about workflows. In this case, different workflows for component
designers and developers to work in a steady rhythm to maintain component
libraries that are then used elsewhere, e.g. in a backend app, or a static app.


## Integrating builds with existing projects

> **What can Modulo integrate with?** Modulo was developed to be
> easy-to-integrate with existing code. In other words, it doesn't matter if
> you use WordPress or Django, Drupal or Rails, Jekyll or Hugo, Modulo
> components can be embedded into your page to add JavaScript-based
> interactivity and more convenient HTML development. Although probably less
> useful, you could conceivably even use it with JavaScript-based generators,
> such as Next.js or Gatsby—in the end, as long as JS and HTML is getting sent
> to a browser, Modulo components can be in the mix!

If you are experienced with other JavaScript build systems, such as those that
are NPM-based (e.g. Webpack, Parcel, Rollup), you might be curious as to how to
practically use Modulo's browser-based build system. Even if you aren't
familiar with other build systems, you might (correctly!) think that in
practice it must get hard to keep track of which JS files, CSS files, and
pre-rendered HTML files should be included in the published version of the
site, and further more that re-building after every change on every single page
on larger sites could get tedious. Also, you might wonder how to integrate this
process with pre-existing web apps, or apply it in a real-life web development
team, as we've thus far only been talking about developing Modulo components in
isolation. This is where _workflow_ comes into play, i.e. the patterns and
procedures you follow to keep a project humming along.


### Example: Integration with legacy PHP project

*Hypothetical integration with legacy PHP project: For example, see below for a
complete page showing including a bundle in a hypothetical existing PHP
project:


```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- Include the output of the bundle command: -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./modulo-bundle.(some hash goes here).css" />
        <script async src="./modulo-bundle.(some hash goes here).js">/script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- The components we define can be used just like before: -->
        <x-HelloWorld goal="10" ></x-HelloWorld>

        <!-- We can also combine other language or templating features: -->
        <?php
            for ($i = 0; $i <= 10; $i++) {
                echo "<x-HelloWorld goal=\"$i\"></x-HelloWorld>";
            }
        ?>
   </body>
</html>
```

## Workflows

When you use Modulo, or any framework, enough, the question arises of
*workflow*, or good patterns of use that facilitate contiued development and
deployment of a product in a team setting. In this section, we'll look over a
few possible approaches to integration.


### Showcase Workflow

> **When to use it** - The *showcase.html workflow* is great if Modulo is only
> going to contribute a few compoennts that you don't update that often. For
> example, maybe you are tasked with enhancing a form interaction, perhaps with
> more validation, so you make a really good new input-type component that has
> certain  form validation features. Then, you use this in your app whenever
> you need it, but it is a bit more "write and forget" in terms of development.

One useful workflow for integrating Modulo with existing projects is to have a
sort of sandbox "testing page" or hidden internal-only "showcase" HTML page
(i.e. similar to a "story book" or "design guide" of components). On this page,
you develop and showcase your re-usable components, both to ease development,
and also to serve as a demonstration for other members of your development team
or organization.

From this "showcase" page, you can then run `build` to generate built JS files
and CSS files whenever you have completed sufficient work on your components
that you want to integrate and release into the rest of the project. The
"self-packing" nature of these builds make the integration no harder than
adding any other script or link tag. This works especially well for small
projects, and avoids the need for a complicated automated build process for
component libraries that you might only occasionally change. One downside of
this workflow is that you might not be able to pre-render any of the pages you
are integrating with, so there might be slight delays in mounting your
components.




###### Try it Now

Try out the "Showcase Workflow" for creating and maintaining a library of built
components that you integrate into another website, such as a backend MVC app.

1. Create a new "showcase" page that imports your component library. 
    - You can put it in `/showcase.html` to make it easy to find.
    - You can even put it in your `/static/` directory to keep it a bit more
      "hidden", e.g.  `/static/showcase/index.html`
2. In your showcase file, import your Modulo header like any other file.
3. Then, to "use" this workflow, work on developing an assortment of components
in isolation on this file. 
4. When you are ready to integrate it with the other app, export the JS and CSS
file, and add script tags to your template of your other app. 
5. Then, in the other app, be sure to include the necessary tags:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./modulo-bundle.(some hash goes here).css" />
    <script async src="./modulo-bundle.(some hash goes here).js">/script>
    ```
6. Now, Modulo components can be used to "spice up" your otherwise simple HTML
templated app!

### Automated Build Workflow

To integrate building file, you can use a `package.json` similar to the
following:

```JSON
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "modulocli ssg -f"
    },
    "modulo": {
        "isCopyOnly": "^static$",
        "output": "build",
        "input": "src"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "express": "4.18.2",
        "mdu.js": "^0.0.63"
    }
}
```

* Consider replacing the `"build": "modulocli ssg -f"` with
something like `"build": "modulocli ssg -f ; mv build/_modulo_output/*
../../path/to/other/app "`  if you are using this to integrate just the JS and
CSS files into your other app


##### Using Git

> **Git** - Git is essential when automating workflows.  If you are brand new,
> you might want to start using git using a GUI. One popular free GUI for Git
> is [GitKraken](https://gitkraken.com/), for macOS, Linux, and Windows. You
> can follow a tutorial about how to use
> [GitKraken here](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/guide/)


### Automated Build Workflow

> **When to use it** - When you are building a Modulo-focused app, and
> automatic building and integration of Modulo in the site is so important.
> It's also important to be able to update frequently, as quickly as you can
> upload your changes with `git push`.

Using the NPM package `modulocli`, you can automate building Modulo. This is
the same Puppeteer based script that this website uses to build itself. It will
loop through all items in input directoyr running the in-browser `build`
command on each, and saving the output to the `build/` directory.

This is the style of building apps that we will cover in _Part 3_ of this
tutorial.

# Library

We've got one more topic for _Part 3_ of the Building Apps tutorial: How to keep
your project manageable with so many components that might have the same name,
or third party components you want to integrate into your project.

## Using libraries

In the previous section, we learned we can use `-src=` to split _Template_ and
_Style_ Component Parts into separate HTML and CSS files respectively. However,
what if our component definition files themselves get too big to manage? That
is, what if we define so many components, that we need to start organizing the
components themselves?

This is where the _Library_ definition tag becomes useful. It allows us to
cluster our components into individual _Component Libraries_, that then get
imported into different _Component namespaces_.

First, re-examine our original _Modulo_ import:

    <script Modulo
        src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js"
        -src="/static/my-stuff.html"
    >/script>

To use a _Library_ definition tag, we move the
`-src="/static/my-stuff.html"` and add a `namespace` to one or more
`<Library>` tags in the _Modulo_ script tag. This ends up looking like the
following:

    <script Modulo src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js">
        <Library
            -src="/static/my-stuff.html"
            namespace="mylib"
        ></Library>
    /script>

> **Why use namespaces?** Namespaces allow different component library files to
> have conflicting component names. This is especially useful when using
> third-party component libraries or while working in a big team: That way, if
> both you and another developer define a component with some common name (eg
> `name="Button"`), there won't be a conflict as long as you load each into
> different namespaces.

Let's break this down:

* `-src="./static/my-stuff.html"`
    
    The `-src` attribute specifies the source of the component library file.
    This file can be anywhere that is accessible to your web-browser or
    web-server. Ideally, it should be in the same place as your CSS and static
    media files, such as a `static/` directory, or whatever the equivalent is
    for your set-up.
    
    The component library itself (`my-stuff.html` in this example) should
    consist of an HTML file filled with `<Component>` definitions.
    
* `namespace="mylib"`
    
    The `namespace` attribute specifies the _namespace prefix_, which is
    combined with a dash and the component name in order to create the
    component's _full name_.
    
    **Example:** If `my-stuff.html` has a component defined like `<Component
    name="MyThing">` imported with `namespace="mylib"`, then the resulting full
    name would be `mylib-MyThing`, and we'd use the component like  
    `<mylib-MyThing></mylib-MyThing>`.
    
* **Multiple libraries:** As we add more and more component libraries to a
  project, we can simply add additional _Library_ definition tags into the
  _Modulo_ script tag. If we accumulate too many _Library_ definition tags that
  it becomes unmanageable to copy and paste them between HTML files, the
  solution is simple: Go back to the same boilerplate you learned in Part 1 of
  the tutorial, except point to a new file that in turn contains all your
  libraries imported and set up as expected. In other words, the
  `Modulo -src="/static/my-stuff.html"` can either point to a file
  containing your components, or a file that contains _Library_ definition tags
  that point in turn to files containing your components.
* **Where to put it:** The Modulo tag can go anywhere in your HTML. For
  neatness, consider putting them either within the `<head>` tag, or near the
  `</body>` closing tag. After being built, it won't matter: The JS script tag
  will be put before the `</body>`.

However, there is a downside to splitting up your files: Each new file you
create will require an additional request to load it. This means that each
additional individual file you include in a page will cause the page to take a
little longer to loader. So, if `-src=` causes it to load slower, how can we
stay neat during development, but still have a fast site? This is where
"building" comes into play.

## Part 1: Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to keep our components in a component library
and then load that library into different HTML files. We finally wrapped up
with trying Modulo's self-building feature.

* `-src=` - A special attribute that allows content in Modulo to be loaded from
  separate files, making it easier to manage as projects grow.
* _Library_ - Allows grouping of Components into library files that can be
  "siloed" under a certain component namespace or configuration.
* _namespace_ - The prefix that replaces the default "x" and goes before the
  name of a component to form the complete component name, e.g. namespace maps
  joins with <Component name="India"> to form a <maps-India> component.
* _build_ - Combining all your JS and CSS together into a single file that
  loads faster, and pre-render the HTML so there's no flicker.
* _hash_ - These unique IDs identify each JS and CSS file that is generated by
  Modulo.
