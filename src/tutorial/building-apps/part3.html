In this section, we'll introduce the SSG / JAMStack template, which is a
template all set-up and ready to go to launch on servers like Netlify.


**DOCUMENTATION STUB NOTE:** *This tutorial is incomplete. This section needs
better explanations, and future sections are missing content.* 🐛

# SSG / JAMStack


> **DecapCMS** is a simple but powerful content management system that can be
> run locally for a GUI Markdown editor of files in your project, or run
> remotely using a third party login auth system (e.g. GitHub's authentication
> system API) to have multiple users contirbute to the same site. This allows
> non technical users to edit the same files as developers, keeping everything
> in one spot (a git repo).

## Terminology 


*Background:* In order to understand this next section, some terminology
background might be useful. 

- *SSG* is Server-side Generated.  This refers to the strategy of running
  Modulo on the webserver so it generates the initial load there, and builds
  the JS and CSS bundle automatically (e.g. developers may not even have to
  think about it, it will just "make it go fast" in the ideal situation). 

- *JAMStack* is a nickname for an approach (stak) for building websites that
  prioritizes JavaScript and Markup being delivered by static servers, with
  (optional) backing in the form of serverless fucntions or custom API app
  servers.  Modulo is a great little framework for this sort of setup, and this
  section of the tutorial will walk through why!

- *CMS* is a "content management system". It allows users to contribute changes
  to the site without having to code. For example, Wordpress is a popular CMS.
  We'll be using _Decap_ as a CMS, since it "plays well" with this JAMStack
  approach.


## Getting started



Modulo has two different ways to start a new JAMStack project: Either a 1) zip
file that you download and then put into a directory you then use a web server
to serve, or 2) by using the `npm` command in the terminal that comes with the
Node.js JavaScript runtime.

Continue to get practice getting a new website project started!



##### Try it now


1. Start a new JAMStack project in one of 2 ways:
    - `.zip` - Go to [/Examples/#StartingTemplate](/examples/#StartingTemplate)
      and download the *JAMStack (Static Site with Markdown and CMS)* zip file
      template
    - **NPM:** - If you have NPM installed, and are comfortable using it, use the
      `create-modulo` script by running the following command (no prior install
      necessary): `npm init modulo`

2. Click aroud, explore the features! 

3. Read the section below for a "tour" of the directory structure. Try
editing each thing and see if you can cause the effects you intend.  **Relevant files to edit:**
    - You will mostly work in the `src/` directory
    - Edit the Markdown files in `src/articles/` to add article or blog-style
      content (also editable by CMS, see below)
    - Edit the files in `src/static/` to work on the CSS, JS, and HTML
      Templates that create Modulo Components (including the "x-Page" layout
      template)
    - Edit the files in `src/static/data/links/` to change the ordering or
      content of the page navigation or article link list (also editable by
      CMS, see below)


4. Using local server and CMS (npm users only)
    - NPM Users Only: If you using Simple Web Server and do not have NPM, skip this step!
    - Try each of the following commands from your new repo:
    - `npm start`
        - Starts a simple HTTP server for convient testing: <http://127.0.0.1:3334/>
    - `npm run startcms`
        - Runs proxy for Decap CMS: <http://127.0.0.1:3334/static/cms/admin/>
        - This is intended for local content editing (it is NOT a live, public site)
        - Note: Run this at the same time as `npm start` (e.g. in another terminal)
    - `npm run build`
        - Generates static site build locally in `build/` directory
        - Useful for testing server-side rendering
        - Note: This requires dependencies. It runs `npm install modulocli` first.

# Markdown

> **What is Markdown?** - Markdown is a handy language for authoring large
> documents in a langauge that is close to HTML, but easier to write. In other
> words, if you are tired of typing `<p>` over and over, maybe writing in
> Markdown and then converting that to HTML will save you effort and
> frustration! Learn more at [Markdown
> Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and
> [MarkdownTutorial.com](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

_Markdown_ is one of the most popualr things to integrate into a static site
generator. The JAMStack template we just installed has a Markdown system setup
and ready to go. Go ahead and open up `/articles/example-article.html` in your
text editor (and browser as well, for comparison). Examine  the HTML code,
as you continue reading below.

## Markdow-HTML

It's time for the Modulo JAMStack magician to reveal a trick! 🎩✨

The Modulo JAMStack template uses something that could be thought of as a sort
of magic trick, a file that is "magically" both an HTML file and Markdown file.
It's a sort of miniature "dual file format" that is as portable as HTML and as
easy-to-edit as Markdown, by being both simultaneously. Let's dig into how it
works.

These files rely on that browsers fill in unclosed tags. Thus, it imports
Modulo and opens a tag at the top to start the page and start interpretting the
rest as Markdown.  This lets it make a file which is simultaneously both a
stand-alone HTML page and a valid Markdown document that can be read by a
Markdown editor (e.g. even a GUI one, assuming that it allows configuring the
"frontmatter delimiter").  They function as an HTML file, since these
Markdown-HTML files can be "double clicked on" and opened with the browser's
`file://` protocol, just like any other HTML file saved with the "SAVE" feature
on this site.

When opened in the browser, the user sees only the final rendered page (not the
markdown source), complete with the markdown code converted into HTML, and any
templating, CSS, custom code, etc applied. When opened with a text editor,
these files resemble Markdown files, as long as you ignore the first line. This
means that true novice coders, who are only comfortable using text editors but
not comfortable with HTML or CSS, can edit these files as long as they don't
touch the first line. 

Furthermore, graphical Markdown editors (notably Decap), can be configured to
accept a custom "frontmatter" deliminator. That means if you configure them to
accept that long HTML string as the frontmatter deliminator, it will hide it
from the user and editing the file will be like any other markdown file. This
allows for properly configured GUI Markdown editors to open up and
transparently edit these Markdown-HTML files as well, while enforcing that the
"magic" words at the top that make it an HTML file as well remain.

##### Try It Now

1. Open up `/articles/example-article.html` in your text editor (and browser as
well, for comparison). Try making changes to the Markdown, to confirm it works.
2. For convenience, the relevant bits are also excerpted the beginning below.
It is displayed "word-wrapping" so you can see the first line in it's entirity.
As long as you don't edit the first line, the file will act like HTML but be
editable like Markdown!


**The first line:**

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML><script Modulo src="/static/js/Modulo.js" -src="/static/cms/">/script><x-ArticlePage><script type=md>---
```


**The rest of the file:**

```
title: The Example Article
subtitle: Why this is the example ever and why you should like it
author: Author Authorino, PhD in Authoring
---

This is an example markdown page. Here is an image:

![](/static/images/example_logo.svg)

Here is some lorem ipsum:
...
```

- **Bonus Challenge:** To see how Decap was configured to accept this custom
  frontmatter, examine `/static/cms/admin/config.yml`

# Launching

Using the NPM package `modulocli`, you can automate building Modulo. This is
the same Puppeteer based script that this website uses to build itself. It will
loop through all items in input directoyr running the in-browser `build`
command on each, and saving the output to the `build/` directory.

## Launching to Netlify

Your project should be ready to launch to Netlify. Just upload or use git to
pus heverything in the exact structure, making sure the `package.json` is intact
at the top level (see below). Netlify should server-side build everything.

## Launching to GitHub Workflows

Your project should be ready to launch to GitHub after the following steps:

1. Download the `modulo.yml` file from here:
    - Direct link:
      <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modulojs/modulojs.org/main/.github/workflows/modulojs.yml>
    - Visible in tree GUI:
      <https://github.com/modulojs/modulojs.org/tree/main/.github/workflows>

2. Ensure it is put in the exact same directory structure:
      - Make a hidden directory structure like: `.github/workflows` in your repo
      - Add the `modulo.yml` file to `.github/workflows`
    -  Ensure GitHub Workflows is enabled on your account

3. If done correctly, every push will trigger an auto-build.


## Custom: Using a package.json

If one of these instructions doesn't work, or your host isn't listed here, you
may need to customize the `package.json` file further.

Many hosts, including Heroku and Netlify, expect a Node.js `package.json` file.
For Modulo.js to automatically build on these servers, we can use a `modulocli`
script as part of the `mdu.js` package to build the site using the same script
that the official site does.

Examine the following one, which is slightly modified from the one that comes
with the template:

```json
{
    "name": "new-modulo-app",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "private": true,
    "description": "...a new project...",
    "scripts": {
        "start": "npm exec -y http-server -- -p 3334 -e html src/",
        "startcms": "cd src ; npm exec -y netlify-cms-proxy-server",
        "build": "modulocli ssg -f"
    },
    "modulo": {
        "isCopyOnly": "^static$",
        "output": "build",
        "input": "src"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "express": "4.18.2",
        "mdu.js": "^0.0.63"
    }
}
```

You can use this `package.json` for your own Modulo projects. This will enable
it to be automatically server-side built every time you upload it to the
server. This can be very convenient, and result in a much better experience for
users than the development version.

- The setting you will mostly likely need to edit are the `"output": "build"`
  setting (`build` is a common default, but others might expect `docs/` (GitHub
  pages) or `output/`).
- You might want to change `input` to be a different value as well. This should
  be where you put all your HTML and other web files (e.g. your "src" or
  "source" files). This is your "www" or your root directory that will be
  hosting all your website, e.g. the `index.html` here should be the one for
  your top-level domain (that is, in this example, `mysite.com/index.html`)
