# Integrating

This section contains advice on integrating Modulo.js with other frameworks.
This might include backend frameworks or other frontend frameworks.

It also talks about workflows. In this case, different workflows for component
designers and developers to work in a steady rhythm to maintain component
libraries that are then used elsewhere, e.g. in a backend app, or a static app.


## Integrating builds with existing projects

> **What can Modulo integrate with?** Modulo was developed to be
> easy-to-integrate with existing code. In other words, it doesn't matter if
> you use WordPress or Django, Drupal or Rails, Jekyll or Hugo, Modulo
> components can be embedded into your page to add JavaScript-based
> interactivity and more convenient HTML development. Although probably less
> useful, you could conceivably even use it with JavaScript-based generators,
> such as Next.js or Gatsby‚Äîin the end, as long as JS and HTML is getting sent
> to a browser, Modulo components can be in the mix!

If you are experienced with other JavaScript build systems, such as those that
are NPM-based (e.g. Webpack, Parcel, Rollup), you might be curious as to how to
practically use Modulo's browser-based build system. Even if you aren't
familiar with other build systems, you might (correctly!) think that in
practice it must get hard to keep track of which JS files, CSS files, and
pre-rendered HTML files should be included in the published version of the
site, and further more that re-building after every change on every single page
on larger sites could get tedious. Also, you might wonder how to integrate this
process with pre-existing web apps, or apply it in a real-life web development
team, as we've thus far only been talking about developing Modulo components in
isolation. This is where _workflow_ comes into play, i.e. the patterns and
procedures you follow to keep a project humming along.


### Example: Integration with legacy PHP project

*Hypothetical integration with legacy PHP project: For example, see below for a
complete page showing including a bundle in a hypothetical existing PHP
project:


```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- Include the output of the bundle command: -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./modulo-bundle.(some hash goes here).css" />
        <script async src="./modulo-bundle.(some hash goes here).js">/script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- The components we define can be used just like before: -->
        <x-HelloWorld goal="10" ></x-HelloWorld>

        <!-- We can also combine other language or templating features: -->
        <?php
            for ($i = 0; $i <= 10; $i++) {
                echo "<x-HelloWorld goal=\"$i\"></x-HelloWorld>";
            }
        ?>
   </body>
</html>
```

## Workflows

When you use Modulo, or any framework, enough, the question arises of
*workflow*, or good patterns of use that facilitate contiued development and
deployment of a product in a team setting. In this section, we'll look over a
few possible approaches to integration.


### Showcase Workflow

> **When to use it** - The *showcase.html workflow* is great if Modulo is only
> going to contribute a few compoennts that you don't update that often. For
> example, maybe you are tasked with enhancing a form interaction, perhaps with
> more validation, so you make a really good new input-type component that has
> certain  form validation features. Then, you use this in your app whenever
> you need it, but it is a bit more "write and forget" in terms of development.

One useful workflow for integrating Modulo with existing projects is to have a
sort of sandbox "testing page" or hidden internal-only "showcase" HTML page
(i.e. similar to a "story book" or "design guide" of components). On this page,
you develop and showcase your re-usable components, both to ease development,
and also to serve as a demonstration for other members of your development team
or organization.

From this "showcase" page, you can then run `build` to generate built JS files
and CSS files whenever you have completed sufficient work on your components
that you want to integrate and release into the rest of the project. The
"self-packing" nature of these builds make the integration no harder than
adding any other script or link tag. This works especially well for small
projects, and avoids the need for a complicated automated build process for
component libraries that you might only occasionally change. One downside of
this workflow is that you might not be able to pre-render any of the pages you
are integrating with, so there might be slight delays in mounting your
components.




###### Try it Now

Try out the "Showcase Workflow" for creating and maintaining a library of built
components that you integrate into another website, such as a backend MVC app.

1. Create a new "showcase" page that imports your component library. 
    - You can put it in `/showcase.html` to make it easy to find.
    - You can even put it in your `/static/` directory to keep it a bit more
      "hidden", e.g.  `/static/showcase/index.html`
2. In your showcase file, import your Modulo header like any other file.
3. Then, to "use" this workflow, work on developing an assortment of components
in isolation on this file. 
4. When you are ready to integrate it with the other app, export the JS and CSS
file, and add script tags to your template of your other app. 
5. Then, in the other app, be sure to include the necessary tags:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./modulo-bundle.(some hash goes here).css" />
    <script async src="./modulo-bundle.(some hash goes here).js">/script>
    ```
6. Now, Modulo components can be used to "spice up" your otherwise simple HTML
templated app!

### Automated Build Workflow

To integrate building file, you can use a `package.json` similar to the
following:

```JSON
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "modulocli ssg -f"
    },
    "modulo": {
        "isCopyOnly": "^static$",
        "output": "build",
        "input": "src"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "express": "4.18.2",
        "mdu.js": "^0.0.63"
    }
}
```

* Consider replacing the `"build": "modulocli ssg -f"` with
something like `"build": "modulocli ssg -f ; mv build/_modulo_output/*
../../path/to/other/app "`  if you are using this to integrate just the JS and
CSS files into your other app


##### Using Git

> **Git** - Git is essential when automating workflows.  If you are brand new,
> you might want to start using git using a GUI. One popular free GUI for Git
> is [GitKraken](https://gitkraken.com/), for macOS, Linux, and Windows. You
> can follow a tutorial about how to use
> [GitKraken here](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/guide/)


### Automated Build Workflow

> **When to use it** - When you are building a Modulo-focused app, and
> automatic building and integration of Modulo in the site is so important.
> It's also important to be able to update frequently, as quickly as you can
> upload your changes with `git push`.

Using the NPM package `modulocli`, you can automate building Modulo. This is
the same Puppeteer based script that this website uses to build itself. It will
loop through all items in input directoyr running the in-browser `build`
command on each, and saving the output to the `build/` directory.

This is the style of building apps that we will cover in _Part 3_ of this
tutorial.

In the next section, we'll learn how *not* integrate Modulo. That is, how to
start a new modulo static site generator project which will server-side render
Modulo components and automatically build JS and CSS when you push.

*When to use it:* When not integrating at all! However


However, you can still try the parts that are done, by continuing to Part 2:
