# Integrating

### Integrating builds with existing projects

> **What can Modulo integrate with?** Modulo was developed to be
> easy-to-integrate with existing code. In other words, it doesn't matter if
> you use WordPress or Django, Drupal or Rails, Jekyll or Hugo, Modulo
> components can be embedded into your page to add JavaScript-based
> interactivity and more convenient HTML development. Although probably less
> useful, you could conceivably even use it with JavaScript-based generators,
> such as Next.js or Gatsby‚Äîin the end, as long as JS and HTML is getting sent
> to a browser, Modulo components can be in the mix!

If you are experienced with other JavaScript build systems, such as those that
are NPM-based (e.g. Webpack, Parcel, Rollup), you might be curious as to how to
practically use Modulo's browser-based build system. Even if you aren't
familiar with other build systems, you might (correctly!) think that in
practice it must get hard to keep track of which JS files, CSS files, and
pre-rendered HTML files should be included in the published version of the
site, and further more that re-building after every change on every single page
on larger sites could get tedious. Also, you might wonder how to integrate this
process with pre-existing web apps, or apply it in a real-life web development
team, as we've thus far only been talking about developing Modulo components in
isolation. This is where _workflow_ comes into play, i.e. the patterns and
procedures you follow to keep a project humming along.

One useful workflow for integrating Modulo with existing projects is to have a
sort of sandbox "testing page" or hidden internal-only "showcase" HTML page
(i.e. similar to a "story book" or "design guide" of components). On this page,
you develop and showcase your re-usable components, both to ease development,
and also to serve as a demonstration for other members of your development team
or organization.

From this "showcase" page, you can then run `build` to generate built JS files
and CSS files whenever you have completed sufficient work on your components
that you want to integrate and release into the rest of the project. The
"self-packing" nature of these builds make the integration no harder than
adding any other script or link tag. This works especially well for small
projects, and avoids the need for a complicated automated build process for
component libraries that you might only occasionally change. One downside of
this workflow is that you might not be able to pre-render any of the pages you
are integrating with, so there might be slight delays in mounting your
components.

For example, see below for a complete page showing including a bundle in a
hypothetical existing PHP project:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- Include the output of the bundle command: -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./modulo-bundle.(some hash goes here).css" />
        <script async src="./modulo-bundle.(some hash goes here).js">/script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- The components we define can be used just like before: -->
        <x-HelloWorld goal="10" ></x-HelloWorld>

        <!-- We can also combine other language or templating features: -->
        <?php
            for ($i = 0; $i <= 10; $i++) {
                echo "<x-HelloWorld goal=\"$i\"></x-HelloWorld>";
            }
        ?>
   </body>
</html>
```
