Welcome to the *Building Apps with Modulo* tutorial!  By following this short
tutorial, you can learn how use Modulo to organize growing web application
projects, inclduding single page apps and JAMStack-style multi-page static
sites.

##### Prerequisites



**Start with Ramping Up** - This is the **second Modulo tutorial**. This
tutorial recommends you first complete most if not all of the first in sequence
Modulo tutorial before you start this one: [Ramping Up With
Modulo](/tutorial/ramping-up/). In general, the following are prerequisites for
taking this tutorial:

* **Software:** A local development server (see right), a code editor
  (such as Geany, Notepad++, or VSCode)
* **OS:** Apple macOS, GNU Linux, or Microsoft Windows
* **Coding skill prerequisites:** Knowledge of HTML & CSS, comfortability
  editing code in a text editor. Familiarity with React, Vue, or similar
  frameworks is helpful due to overlap in concepts, but not required.



---------------


### _Ready to start building bigger and better apps with Modulo?_

üë∑ üèóÔ∏è üì¶ Let's _BUILD_! 

# Modulo Source

In the [Ramping Up With Modulo](/tutorial/ramping-up/), we learned how to add a
component embedded on the same page that it is used. This is not recommended.
Instead, you should put your components in a separate component library HTML
file, and then importing them into each HTML file that needs them.

This can be done by simply copying the insides of the `<script Modulo` ... tag,
and pasting them into a new file. Then, you must include a special `-src`
attribute to specify the new file. See below:


```html
<script Modulo
    src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js"
    -src="/some/path/to/my_components.html"
>/script>
```

This "4-liner" can now be included in any of your HTML files to import whatever
components you have defined in `/some/path/to/my_components.html`. This allows you
to share the same components across multiple pages.

## Where to put your components?

Modulo recommends your "top level" components, or your first or main
components, be defined in `/static/index.html`. The `/static/` directory is
chosen because it is often the one used for files that should not get
static-site generated. Using that filename makes your "boilerplate" on each
file that needs them becomes as short as possible, since the `index.html` is
the standard default.

## Boilerplate variations


### Single lines (with unpkg CDN)


Following the previous examples, using `index.html` and the default scheme
(protocol), the boilerplate of a Moudulo HTML page becomes a "one-liner", just
at the 80 character limit:

```html
<!doctype html><script Modulo src="//unpkg.com/mdu.js" -src="/static/">/script>

<x-App>
    <div>Lorem Ipsum</div>
    <!-- etc... -->
</x-App>
```

> **CDN** - CDNs are [Content Delivery
> Networks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN), and
> generally the system by which static assets are distributed across web
> servers for speedy websites.  In our case, we care about JavaScript CDNs that
> let us quickly load Modulo.js and/or third-party JavaScript libraries from
> the NPM.js repository, without having to use NPM the command-line client.

### Multiple lines (with unpkg CDN)

Some might prefer shorter lines and pinning a version number (which, regardless
of, formatting, is always wise when possible!):

```html
<script Modulo
    src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js@0.0.63/src/Modulo.js"
    -src="/static/"
>/script>
```


### Locally hosted variation (single line)

In the previous tutorial, and when you use `npm init modulo` or a `.zip`
starter template, the 2000 line Modulo.js file will be included locally (and
thus also pinned).  See below:

```html
<!doctype html><script Modulo src="/static/js/Modulo.js" -src="/static/" >/script>
```


## Summary

1. Move your components from an embedded definition to a separate file so it can
  be share between pages
2. Name the file `static/index.html` (i.e., the "folder name" is "static")
3. Include the file with `-src="/static/"`

*Let's practice!*


##### Learning Tips

* *Tip 1:* The *Try It Now* instructions tell you to apply the concepts you
  learn. Most will have sample code to copy and paste. The goal is to edit the
  sample code correctly and so that you can apply the lesson you learned on a
  app you develop using your local developmet server on your computer. That is,
  put the learning into practice!

* *Tip 2:* Either use the starting file below, or consider trying each concept
  on an app you are building.

**Starting File:** Click the `SAVE` button under the `RUN` button to have a
"testing file" to use in this tutorial.

```modulo_demo_example
<Props
    text
></Props>
<Template>
    <h1>{{ props.text|default:"Modulo App" }}</h1>
    <hr />
    <p><button @click:="script.doCountup">COUNT</button></p>
    <p>{{ state.num }}</p>
    <slot></slot>
</Template>
<State
    num:=0
></State>
<Script>
    function doCountup() {
        state.num++;
    }
/Script>
<Style>
    :host {
        --light-shading-color: #ffffff55;
        --dark-shading-color: #00000015;
        display: block;
        background: var(--background-color);
    }
    :host, button {
        border: 5px var(--primary-color) ridge;
        font-size: 2rem;
        text-align: center;
        box-shadow:
            8px 8px 10px inset var(--light-shading-color),
            -8px -8px 10px inset var(--dark-shading-color);
    }
    h1 {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
    }
    button {
        background: var(--primary-color);
        color: var(--background-color);
        font-weight: bold;
        border-style: outset;
        display: inline-block;
    }
    button:active {
        border-style: inset;
    }
</Style>
<!-- %%% App %%% -->

<x-App
    text="My App"
    style="
        --primary-color: tomato;
        --background-color: cornsilk;
    "
></x-App>

```


##### Try It Now


**Practice cutting out an embedded component and moving it to a `static/`
directory.**

1. Create a new "static" directory (i.e. *folder*) to house your component
library files.
    - Ensure it's `static`, all lowercase, so the tutorial code snippets will
      match
2. Create a new file called `index.html` to hold your _Component_ code:
3. Copy your existing component definition from your embedded HTML file into
this new file, and then delete it from your main HTML file.
4. Add a `-src=` attribute to your Modulo script tag, pointing toward the
`static` directory, e.g. `-src="/static/"`
5. Refresh the web browser to view the results.
    - If done correctly, nothing should change compared to the component being
      embedded, i.e. it should have the same behavior if it is being loaded
      from another file
    - To confirm it's working, try editing your component in the library file
      and refresh to see the results. Try force refreshing if you have trouble
      with the file changes when you save not being noticed.


##### RESULTS

- If done correctly, your new component library file (e.g.
  `/static/index.html`) should contain the following text (note the lack of
  `<script Modulo ...` etc):
    ```
    <!-- Component library (/static/index.html) -->
    <Component name="App">
        <!-- ... snip ... -->
    </Component>
    ```

- For example, if you named everything based on the above suggestions, your new
  Modulo tag / new  might look like:
    ```
    <script Modulo
        src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js"
        -src="/static/"
    >/script>
    ```

- Now, you can simply "drop in" these 4 lines of script tag on multiple HTML
  pages, and they will be all you need to import and share the same set of
  components between pages.

##### Bonus Challenge

- Try practicing with multiple "main HTML" files (e.g. `/index.html` or
  `/about.html` or "Modulo_App.html" or something) sharing a single Component
  library (e.g.  `/static/index.html`)

- Try defining multiple components in one Component library HTML file


------

# CPart Source

In the previous section, `-src=` was used on a `<script Modulo ...` tag to move
components into a separate file. While this is enough for a few _Component_
definitions, pretty soon, once you start writing dozens of components, you'll
be back to having one big, unwieldy file to edit.

This is why there's a feature of Modulo to "split off" CParts (individually)
into separate files. This allows you to work with dedicated `.html`, `.css`,
and `.js` files separately, instead of embedding everything into a single,
unwieldy HTML file.    Thus, the next thing to learn is how the `-src=`
attribute can be used on anything in Modulo, notably individual Component
Parts.


## Splitting off CParts


> **Splitting off definitions** - Any definition in Modulo can be "split off"
> into a > separate file. Begin by cutting out the contents, and pasting them
> in a new file, and then save this new file in somewhere in your static
> directory.  Finally, to re-include it, add a `-src=` attribute to CPart, just
> as we did with the Modulo tag. Note the dash (`-`) before it. This is what
> distinguishes it from an ordinary src attribute, which Modulo will ignore. By
> default, `-src=` is supported by any definition that uses it's contents, so
> that means _Template_, _Style_, _Script_, _StaticData_, _Component_,
> _Modulo_, along with ones we'll cover later, such as _Library_,
> _Configuration_, and _Artifact_.

### Examples of using "-src="

For example, if we start with:

```
<Template>
    <p>It's template time!</p>
</Template>
<Style>
    p { color: blue }
</Style>
```

To "cut out" these CParts, we... 

1. Copy `<p>It's template time!</p>` into it's own
separate file (for example) called `my-template-stuff.html`, and...

2. Copy  `p { color: blue }` into it's own
separate file (for example) called `stylish-paragraphs.css`, and finally...

3. We replace the content with `-src=` attributes pointing to
the files we made.

Once we're done, the component would look like this:

```
<Template
    -src="./my-template-stuff.html"
></Template>
<Style
    -src="./stylish-paragraphs.css"
></Style>
```



### Paths and "-src="

The rules for -src= relative paths are similar to HTML's rules: Any URI path
can be specified, and use a dot (.) to specify a path relative to the current
HTML file (e.g. the Component library file). The behavior is the exact same as
if you had included the text in the same file, meaning this feature is only
intended to be used when a component library gets too long and difficult to
edit. In that case, conventional usage is to start splitting off larger CParts
into their own files, until the HTML library file itself is just tie-ing
everything together.

## Directory structure

### Learning Tip

* If you want a deep dive into recommended directory structures, keep on
  reading.  Otherwise, skip over to the _TRY IT NOW_ section below.

#### Refactor #1: Inititial structure

*Used here, in Building Apps: Part 1*

- For Component definitions:
    - `/static/index.html` for the _Component_ "header" file (e.g., just top level definitions)
- For Component Parts (CParts):
    - Name all CParts based on a reasonable extension, e.g. for `MyComponentName`:
    - `/static/components/MyComponentName.html` (for _Template_)
    - `/static/components/MyComponentName.css` (for _Style_)
    - `/static/components/MyComponentName.js` (for _Script_)
    - `/static/components/MyComponentName.json` (for _StaticData_)


#### Refactor #2: Grouped each component

*Used with templates in Building Apps: Part 2*

- A possible solution would be to add further layers of directories, such as
  one to group each component
- e.g.  `/components/Page/Page.html` `/components/Page/Page.css`,
  `/components/MainForm/MainForm.html`, and `/components/MainForm/MainForm.js`,
  etc


#### Refactor #3: Grouping into libraries

*Not used in tutorial.*

- Splitting components:
    - If you have dozens of components, you might want to start grouping them
      together into "libraries". 
    - In this case you might have files like:
      `/components/layout/Page/Page.html`, `/components/layout/Page/Page.css`,
      `/components/forms/MainForm/MainForm.html`, and
      `/components/forms/MainForm/MainForm.js`, etc
- Splitting "header" file as well:
    - If your `index.html` is getting too big, you can start spliting it into
      libraries as well, and importing them with `<Modulo -src=...>` style
      imports within your top-level `/index.html` (or, `<Library -src=...>`,
      covered in Part 2). 
    - In the previous example you might have a file at the top level like
      `/components/index.html`, which in turn brings in
      `/components/layout/index.html`, `/components/forms/index.html`, etc

##### Try It Now


**Practice splitting your components into separate HTML, JS, and CSS files in a
static directory**

1. Create a new `components` directory in your `static` directory
    - Ensure the full path, then, is `static/components`, so the
      tutorial code snippets will match
2. One by one, snip out the HTML, CSS, and optionally JS code from each
Component you have defined in `index.html`
3. Create as many as 3 new files per component in `static/components/`
    - Name each after the component with a `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` file
      extension, one for each CPart (_Template_, _Style_, and _Script_)
    - Paste in the content of each CPart
4. Add a `-src=` attribute to each of the 3 CParts
5. Refresh the web browser to view the results.
    - If done correctly, nothing should change compared, so to confirm it's
      working, try editing your CParts in their individual files

##### RESULTS

If done correctly, your new component library file (e.g.
`/static/index.html`) should contain code that looks similar to the following code:

```
<!-- Component library (/static/index.html) -->
<Component name="App">
    <Props
        text
    ></Props>
    <Template
        -src="./components/App.html"
    ></Template>
    <State
        num:=0
    ></State>
    <Script
        -src="./components/App.js"
    >/Script>
    <Style
        -src="./components/App.css"
    ></Style>
</Component>
```


##### Comprehension questions


- How does this technqiue cause the component library file
  (`components/index.html`) become more clean and easy to use?
    - **Answer:**
    - With this technique `index.html` file, will mostly just be the "header"
      or high-level information on each Component
    - The "guts" of each component, which is what developers spend most of
      their time editing, will go into separate files with appropriate
      extensions

# CDN Source

> **Unpkg vs other CDNs** - The Modulo documentation uses the [unpkg
> CDN](https://unpkg.com/). You can use any CDN that supports serving
> JavaScript. A couple other popular alternative CDNs which should work with
> Modulo include: [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/),
> [JSDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) and [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com)


The final use of the `-src=` is to quickly bring in JavaScript from NPM. Don't
worry, even if you don't have NPM installed locally, you can still use this
feature, thanks to use of the *unpkg.com CDN*, which in turn fetches NPM
packages so we don't have to  (see aside).


## JavaScript dependencies as -src

Including a `-src=` attribute will bring in that source code and execute it in
the current script static context. That means it's private to that script, and
can be used as a helper function there.

Here's a demo of this from the ModuloJS homepage:

```modulo_demo
<!-- This component generates a "type-as-you-go" Markdown
preview. It uses -src= as a quick way to bring in the
needed NPM dependency from the unpkg CDN. -->
<Template>
    <textarea [state.bind] name="text"></textarea>
    <div>{{ script.html|safe }}</div>
</Template>

<State
text="### Markdown
Using `-src` to *quickly* add a **markdown parser**"
></State>

<Script -src="https://unpkg.com/snarkdown">
    const { snarkdown } = this; // (this === window)
    function prepareCallback() {
        return { // Every rerender, convert markdown to HTML
            html: snarkdown(state.text),
        };
    }
/Script>

<Style>
  textarea, div {
      border: none;
      width: 95%;
      padding: 2%;
      min-height: 80px;
  }
</Style>
```


## Using Configuration

A better solution is to use a Configuration Definition to integrate third party
javascript.  _Configuration_ definitions are _not_ the same as a _Script_
CPart. It will run before everything else, and is great for bringing in
definitions using the `-src=` attribute.  These should go along side your
components, above everything.

See this example, which is the code used by the template we'll use in _Part 2_:

```
<script Configuration -src="https://unpkg.com/showdown/dist/showdown.min.js">
    // Register "getMarkdownData" function, using "showdown" to convert
    // markdown to HTML (including parsing meta data)
    function getMarkdownData(source) {
        const converter = new showdown.Converter({ metadata: true });
        const html = converter.makeHtml(source);
        const data = converter.getMetadata();
        data.body = html; //Object.assign(String(html), { safe: true });
        return data;
    }
    modulo.register('util', getMarkdownData);
/script>

<Component name="App">
    <!-- ... etc ... -->
</Component>
```


## Integrating a frontend plugin

One of the most classic JavaScript libraries is CKEditor, a rich text editing
system. As an example, this is very easy to initially integrate with `-src=`
into a Modulo-powered Web Component.

For this final example, we can practice doing it yourself, by following the
example procedure described below.

##### Try It Now

Can you integrate the CKEditor so it displays by following the two clues below?
If you get stuck, try the embedded solution at the end.


```modulo_demo_example
<Script> // Step 1: Fill in -src=""
    function updateCallback() {
        // Step 2: Add code to integrate
        //console.log(element);
    }
/Script>
<!--%%% CKEdit %%%-->
<x-CKEdit>Edit <strong>me</strong> with CKEdit!</x-CKEdit>
```


##### Clue 1


**The [CKEditor CDN website](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/) provides the following example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>CKEditor</title>
        <script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/39.0.2/classic/ckeditor.js">/script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="editor"></div>
        <script>
            ClassicEditor
                .create(document.querySelector('#editor'))
                .then(editor => { console.log(editor) })
                .catch( error => { console.error(error) } );
        /script>
    </body>
</html>
```


##### Clue 2

**Steps to integrate:** We can transform many front-end libraries into a Modulo
component using the following 2 steps:

1. Take their provided CDN tag and put it in the `-src=` of a _Script_ CPart
2. Copy the example script tag and change references (e.g. often id selectors)
to DOM to simply `element` (so it attaches to the Component's host element)


*Embedded Demo Limitation:* Due to the way the TRY IT NOW embedded "mini-demos"
don't attempt to "sandbox" very much, and the way that CKEditor sets up it's
own JavaScript data structures globally, it will break if you attempt to re-run
it over and over in the same embedded mini-demo. Try using the ACE-based demo,
or working locally if that becomes a nuissance.


##### SOLUTION

When these two steps are followed with the clues provided, we get the following
functioning component:

```modulo_demo_example
<Script -src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/39.0.2/classic/ckeditor.js">
    function updateCallback() {
        ClassicEditor
            .create(element)
            .then(editor => {
                element.editor = editor; // in case we need it later!
            })
            .catch(error => console.error( error ));
        // (Optional) Prevent component from rerendering
        // element.rerender = () => {};
    }
/Script>
<!--%%% CKEdit %%%-->
<x-CKEdit>Edit <strong>me</strong> with CKEdit!</x-CKEdit>
```

------


### Alternative integration: Using mount references

In most cases, you might prefer to mount *within* the element, so you can add
extra styling or other HTML to more properly "wrap around" it:

```
<Template>
    <div [script.editor]></div>
</Template>
<Script -src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/39.0.2/classic/ckeditor.js">
    function editorMount({ el }) {
        ClassicEditor
            .create(el)
            .then(editor => {
                element.editor = editor; // in case we need it later!
            })
            .catch(error => console.error( error ));
    }
/Script>
```


### Alternative integration: Using Configuration and Mount

Perhaps the best case is using a Configuration script, and moving it out of the
Component entirely:



```
<script Configuration -src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/39.0.2/classic/ckeditor.js">
    modulo.register('util', ClassicEditor, { name: 'ClassicEditor' });
/script>
<Component name="App">
    <Template>
        <div [script.editor]></div>
    </Template>
    <Script>
        function editorMount({ el }) {
            ClassicEditor.create(el) // Etc, same as before
        }
    /Script>
</Component>
```

## Part 1: Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to keep our components in a component library
and then load that library into different HTML files. We finally wrapped up
with trying Modulo's self-building feature.

* `-src=` - A special attribute that allows content in Modulo to be loaded from
  separate files, making it easier to manage as projects grow.
