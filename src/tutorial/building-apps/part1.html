##### Prerequisites



**Start with Ramping Up** - This is the **second Modulo tutorial**. This
tutorial recommends you first complete most if not all of the first in sequence
Modulo tutorial before you start this one: [Ramping Up With
Modulo](/tutorial/ramping-up/). In general, the following are prerequisites for
taking this tutorial:

* **Software:** A local development server (see right), a code editor
  (such as Geany, Notepad++, or VSCode)
* **OS:** Apple macOS, GNU Linux, or Microsoft Windows
* **Coding skill prerequisites:** Knowledge of HTML & CSS, comfortability
  editing code in a text editor. Familiarity with React, Vue, or similar
  frameworks is helpful due to overlap in concepts, but not required.

### _Ready to start building bigger and better apps with Modulo?_

üë∑ üèóÔ∏è üì¶ Let's _BUILD_! 

# Using Sources

In the [Ramping Up With Modulo](/tutorial/ramping-up/), we learned how to add a
component embedded on the same page that it is used. This is not recommended.
Instead, you should put your components in a separate component library HTML
file, and then importing them into each HTML file that needs them.

This can be done by simply copying the insides of the `<script Modulo` ... tag,
and pasting them into a new file. Then, you must include a special `-src`
attribute to specify the new file. See below:


```html
<script Modulo
    src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js"
    -src="/some/path/to/my_components.html"
>/script>
```

This "4-liner" can now be included in any of your HTML files to import whatever
components you have defined in `/some/path/to/my_components.html`. This allows you
to share the same components across multiple pages.

## Where to put your components?

Modulo recommends your "top level" components, or your first or main
components, be defined in `/static/index.html`. The `/static/` directory is
chosen because it is often the one used for files that should not get
static-site generated. That way, your "boilerplate" on each file that needs
them becomes as short as possible:

```html
<script Modulo
    src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js"
    -src="/static/"
>/script>
```



##### Learning Tips

* *Tip 1:* The *Try It Now* instructions tell you to apply the concepts you
  learn. Most will have sample code to copy and paste. The goal is to edit the
  sample code correctly and so that you can apply the lesson you learned on a
  app you develop using your local developmet server on your computer. That is,
  put the learning into practice!

* *Tip 2:* Either use the starting file below, or consider trying each concept
  on an app you are building.

**Starting File:** Click the `SAVE` button under the `RUN` button to have a
"testing file" to use in this tutorial.

```modulo_demo_example
<Props
    text
></Props>
<Template>
    <h1>{{ props.text|default:"Modulo App" }}</h1>
    <hr />
    <p><button @click:="script.doCountup">COUNT</button></p>
    <p>{{ state.num }}</p>
    <slot></slot>
</Template>
<State
    num:=0
></State>
<Script>
    function doCountup() {
        state.num++;
    }
/Script>
<Style>
    :host {
        --light-shading-color: #ffffff55;
        --dark-shading-color: #00000015;
        display: block;
        background: var(--background-color);
    }
    :host, button {
        border: 5px var(--primary-color) ridge;
        font-size: 2rem;
        text-align: center;
        box-shadow:
            8px 8px 10px inset var(--light-shading-color),
            -8px -8px 10px inset var(--dark-shading-color);
    }
    h1 {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
    }
    button {
        background: var(--primary-color);
        color: var(--background-color);
        font-weight: bold;
        border-style: outset;
        display: inline-block;
    }
    button:active {
        border-style: inset;
    }
</Style>
<!-- %%% App %%% -->

<x-App
    text="My App"
    style="
        --primary-color: tomato;
        --background-color: cornsilk;
    "
></x-App>

```


##### Try It Now


**Practice cutting out an embedded component and moving it to a `static/`
directory.**

1. Create a new "static" directory (i.e. *folder*) to house your component
library files.
    - Ensure it's `static`, all lowercase, so the tutorial code snippets will
      match
2. Create a new file called `index.html` to hold your _Component_ code:
3. Copy your existing component definition from your embedded HTML file into
this new file, and then delete it from your main HTML file.
4. Add a `-src=` attribute to your Modulo script tag, pointing toward the
`static` directory, e.g. `-src="/static/"`
5. Refresh the web browser to view the results.
    - If done correctly, nothing should change compared to the component being
      embedded, i.e. it should have the same behavior if it is being loaded
      from another file
    - To confirm it's working, try editing your component in the library file
      and refresh to see the results. Try force refreshing if you have trouble
      with the file changes when you save not being noticed.


##### RESULTS

- If done correctly, your new component library file (e.g.
  `/static/index.html`) should contain the following text (note the lack of
  `<script Modulo ...` etc):
    ```
    <!-- Component library (/static/index.html) -->
    <Component name="App">
        <!-- ... snip ... -->
    </Component>
    ```

- For example, if you named everything based on the above suggestions, your new
  Modulo tag / new  will look like:
    ```
    <script Modulo
        src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js"
        -src="/static/"
    >/script>
    ```

- Now, you can simply "drop in" these 4 lines of script tag on multiple HTML
  pages, and they will be all you need to import and share the same set of
  components between pages.

##### Bonus Challenge

- Try practicing with multiple "main HTML" files (e.g. `/index.html` or
  `/about.html` or "Modulo_App.html" or something) sharing a single Component
  library (e.g.  `/static/index.html`)

- Try defining multiple components in one Component library HTML file

## Splitting off larger CParts

A convenient feature of Modulo is the ability to "split off" CParts
(individually) into separate files. This allows you to work with dedicated
`.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files separately, instead of embedding everything
into a single, unwieldy HTML file.

In the previous section, `-src=` was used on a <script Modulo ... tag to move
components into a separate file. Now, we'll see how this same attribute can be
used on individual Componnt Parts.

## Using `-src=`

To "split off" a long CPart into a separate file, begin by cutting out the
contents of a CPart, and pasting it in a new file, and then save this new file
in the same directory as your component library. Finally, to re-include it, add
a -src= attribute to CPart, just as we did with the Modulo tag. Note the dash
(-) before it. This is what distinguishes it from an ordinary src attribute,
which Modulo will ignore. By default, -src= is supported by any CPart that uses
it's contents, meaning Template and Style are the only two that we've learned
so far that support it.

For example, you can split off a Template into it's own separate file, as such:

```
<Template
    -src="./my-file-name.html"
></Template>
```

Similarly, you can split off a Style as well:

```
<Style
    -src="./some/other/path.css"
></Style>
```

The rules for -src= relative paths are similar to HTML's rules: Any URI path
can be specified, and use a dot (.) to specify a path relative to the current
HTML file (e.g. the Component library file). The behavior is the exact same as
if you had included the text in the same file, meaning this feature is only
intended to be used when a component library gets too long and difficult to
edit. In that case, conventional usage is to start splitting off larger CParts
into their own files, until the HTML library file itself is just tie-ing
everything together.


# Library

We've got one more topic for _Part 1_ of the Building Apps tutorial: How to keep
your project manageable and loading fast as you accumulate more and more
_Component_ definitions, and they require more and more files.

## Using libraries

In the previous section, we learned we can use `-src=` to split _Template_ and
_Style_ Component Parts into separate HTML and CSS files respectively. However,
what if our component definition files themselves get too big to manage? That
is, what if we define so many components, that we need to start organizing the
components themselves?

This is where the _Library_ definition tag becomes useful. It allows us to
cluster our components into individual _Component Libraries_, that then get
imported into different _Component namespaces_.

First, re-examine our original _Modulo_ import:

    <script Modulo
        src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js"
        -src="/static/my-stuff.html"
    >/script>

To use a _Library_ definition tag, we move the
`-src="/static/my-stuff.html"` and add a `namespace` to one or more
`<Library>` tags in the _Modulo_ script tag. This ends up looking like the
following:

    <script Modulo src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js">
        <Library
            -src="/static/my-stuff.html"
            namespace="mylib"
        ></Library>
    /script>

> **Why use namespaces?** Namespaces allow different component library files to
> have conflicting component names. This is especially useful when using
> third-party component libraries or while working in a big team: That way, if
> both you and another developer define a component with some common name (eg
> `name="Button"`), there won't be a conflict as long as you load each into
> different namespaces.

Let's break this down:

* `-src="./static/my-stuff.html"`
    
    The `-src` attribute specifies the source of the component library file.
    This file can be anywhere that is accessible to your web-browser or
    web-server. Ideally, it should be in the same place as your CSS and static
    media files, such as a `static/` directory, or whatever the equivalent is
    for your set-up.
    
    The component library itself (`my-stuff.html` in this example) should
    consist of an HTML file filled with `<Component>` definitions.
    
* `namespace="mylib"`
    
    The `namespace` attribute specifies the _namespace prefix_, which is
    combined with a dash and the component name in order to create the
    component's _full name_.
    
    **Example:** If `my-stuff.html` has a component defined like `<Component
    name="MyThing">` imported with `namespace="mylib"`, then the resulting full
    name would be `mylib-MyThing`, and we'd use the component like  
    `<mylib-MyThing></mylib-MyThing>`.
    
* **Multiple libraries:** As we add more and more component libraries to a
  project, we can simply add additional _Library_ definition tags into the
  _Modulo_ script tag. If we accumulate too many _Library_ definition tags that
  it becomes unmanageable to copy and paste them between HTML files, the
  solution is simple: Go back to the same boilerplate you learned in Part 1 of
  the tutorial, except point to a new file that in turn contains all your
  libraries imported and set up as expected. In other words, the
  `Modulo¬†-src="/static/my-stuff.html"` can either point to a file
  containing your components, or a file that contains _Library_ definition tags
  that point in turn to files containing your components.
* **Where to put it:** The Modulo tag can go anywhere in your HTML. For
  neatness, consider putting them either within the `<head>` tag, or near the
  `</body>` closing tag. After being built, it won't matter: The JS script tag
  will be put before the `</body>`.

However, there is a downside to splitting up your files: Each new file you
create will require an additional request to load it. This means that each
additional individual file you include in a page will cause the page to take a
little longer to loader. So, if `-src=` causes it to load slower, how can we
stay neat during development, but still have a fast site? This is where
"building" comes into play.

# Build

> **Why build?** Let's start with a "thought experiment", where we fast forward
> into the future. Imagine that as you create more and more components, you
> begin splitting them up into more component libraries. Also, as mentioned
> previously, perhaps you find some nice component libraries that others have
> made that you want to use in your project. In the end, you might find
> yourself with dozens of HTML files being loaded, scattered in different
> directories.
> 
> In this situation you will have too many `<Library>` tags, meaning your page
> may take a long time to start-up. As it's downloading all the different
> files, the browser will be showing the ugly, unformatted text in the
> mean-time. On slow connections, this could be end up being a frustrating
> experience for users. This is why building to one file is useful.

### Building: Packing it all up

"Building" is a feature of Modulo where it packs up all the components,
JavaScript, and CSS you have loaded on a particular page into single `.js` and
`.css` files, respectively. This single file file, called a _build_, contains
all the code from all your components (including CParts that were split off
using `-src=`).

These "builds" are fully independent: Once the "build" file is included using a
`<script¬†src="...">`, all your components on that page will work, without any
need for including Modulo or your libraries specifically. In other words, this
tag replaces all the boilerplate you have on your page, and you can remove all
the importing-type code (e.g. `<script¬†Modulo>`) from your HTML files,
replacing it only with the single script tag. Not only that, it will also
pre-compile JavaScript code, removing the need for "eval", and reducing file
sizes. This causes the components to load much faster.

Generally, developers create builds before "launching" their site to
"production" (e.g. publishing their site for the world to see), since it
results in the fastest possible loading time. Note that you should only attempt
to edit your original, source files: Builds are only for releasing or
publishing, but not for editing. Never directly edit builds; instead, create
new ones.

### Pre-rendering HTML for instant loading

Even with built JavaScript code, you might notice that there is a "flicker"
effect, where the page remains unstructured and unstyled until all your
components finish rendering their _Templates_. Depending on how complicated
your page is, this could be brief and forgivable, or could take a while and
create a bad user experience. One option is to add a "Spinner" to your page,
that is removed once things are loaded. Another option is to use pre-rendered
HTML.

Modulo can pre-render HTML as well, and output a brand new HTML file that can
be published instead of your original one. A "pre-rendered HTML" file is a
special, processed HTML file which basically "freezes" the result of loading
the page for the first time. You can use this messy, processed HTML file as a
drop-in replacement to your previous HTML page when launching, as it will
already have JavaScript and CSS tags included for your build!

To build a project, we will need to use the _Modulo Command Menu_. The
_console_ is a feature of all web browsers. As a web developer you likely have
used it: It's a panel, hidden by default, where JS, CSS, and other such error
messages are displayed. While most JS frameworks require NPM-based tools to
build, Modulo can be built right from your browser's console, simply clicking
on the `build` commands in the `COMMAND` menu, that is visible in your browser
developer tools console.

Build files will look like: `modulo-build-xx4bz9v4.js`,
`modulo-build-x9f2za71.css`. Note the so-called "hash" (e.g. ‚Äúxx4bz9v4‚Äù): These
unique IDs identify each JS and CSS file that is generated by Modulo. If you
change something in your components, you will cause one (or both) of these
hashes to change, if they end up affecting the component's behavior (`.js`) or
it's appearance (`.css`).

##### Try it now

1.  Open up your HTML file in your browser (e.g. Firefox or Chrome/Chromium).
Do not open your component library HTML files: Be sure to open the file that
_is doing the importing_ and _using the components_, not the file(s) that
contain the component definitions themselves.
2.  Bring up the console: Press `Control+Shift+J` (Linux, Windows) or
`Command+Option+J` (macOS) on your keyboard to open the Console. Alternatively,
you can right-click with your mouse and select "Inspect", and then go to the
_Console_ tab.
3.  _Optional:_ Within the newly opened developer tools, navigate for a moment
to the "Network" tab. Force refresh your browser. You should see a list of
"requests" being sent, including one for each component library that needs
loading. For example, if we named our component library
"./static/my-component-lib.html", we'll see an additional request for this
HTML file. If we had further split our files using "-src=", we'll see even more
requests.
4.  Do you see a Modulo logo (`%`), with the word `COMMANDS`? Click on
`COMMANDS`, and possibly one more time (on Firefox), and you should see a
command menu, containing commands like `build` and `test`. To build, simply
click the "`build`" command.
    
    Note: Look in the upper-right hand of your browser. You might see a
    warning, prompting you about "Allowing multiple downloads". You should
    allow it, otherwise it will block the generated files from being
    downloaded. If you see no warnings about this, then just continue to the
    next step.
    
5.  Your browser should reload, and then offer to download an HTML, CSS, and JS
file, or perhaps offer a way to save them. These are the "build" files, and
contain the contents of all libraries that were loaded on this page, with
underlying JavaScript pre-compiled for speed and security. Save them all
together in some spot.
6.  The HTML "build" is a copy of the HTML page you were working on, with two
important differences:
7.  Difference #1: It's been modified to include the built versions of the CSS
and JS: A link tag to include the CSS file is inserted before the `</head>`,
and a script tag inserted before the `</body>` tag to include the JS file.
8.  Difference #2: It contains the page's _current_ state, e.g., the result of
an initial render. This means that when that HTML page is loaded, it will be
"prerendered", and thus appear to load much faster, and components will render
correctly, even before the JavaScript finishes loading.
9.  Now, open up your "build" file. If all went well, it should look and behave
exactly as before, except load much faster.

_Tip:_ If all went well after building, you should see a link to the command
you just ran. Clicking on the link will refresh the page, causing it to build
again. You can also just hit refresh (Ctrl+R or Command+R) to rebuild. Consider
keeping this window open, or as another tab, and resuming work in another
window. Then, to rebuild, simply switch back to this window, and either click
the button or hit refresh!

**Important: Don't edit your builds!** Built files are disposable. Don't edit
the HTML, JS, or CSS files produced. Instead, continue working on your original
"source" files, and then build again. The purpose of these new "built" files is
to only share them when you are done with your website. These should only be
used when "launching" your site. Your development should continue on the
"source" files.

This can easily trip up beginners: The build "freezes" the component library in
time, and you'll have to run build again if you change anything. A common
mistake is forgetting that you are editing the original `.html` file while
using the built `.js` version, causing much confusion as to why your changes
don't take effect!

## Part 1: Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to keep our components in a component library
and then load that library into different HTML files. We finally wrapped up
with trying Modulo's self-building feature.

* `-src=` - A special attribute that allows content in Modulo to be loaded from
  separate files, making it easier to manage as projects grow.
* _Library_ - Allows grouping of Components into library files that can be
  "siloed" under a certain component namespace or configuration.
* _namespace_ - The prefix that replaces the default "x" and goes before the
  name of a component to form the complete component name, e.g. namespace maps
  joins with <Component name="India"> to form a <maps-India> component.
* _build_ - Combining all your JS and CSS together into a single file that
  loads faster, and pre-render the HTML so there's no flicker.
* _hash_ - These unique IDs identify each JS and CSS file that is generated by
  Modulo.
