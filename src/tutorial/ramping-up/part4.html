# Shadow & Slots

This next section in the tutorial switches gears a bit, and revisits our
`<Component>` and `<Style>` definitions. It's also not needed for a lot of
users, so if you are in a hurry and feel your CSS is in a good spot, [feel free
to skip down to events section](#events), and come back when you hit a wall
with isolating CSS or good component design. However, if you want to know the
CSS tools available and how to use component children, continue reading on.

## Putting elements into slots

> **The origin of slots** Slots are a feature of the "shadow DOM", a new-ish
> feature of web browsers. Modulo replicates the same behavior of these
> "shadow" slots, making slots even easier to use without JavaScript.

Let's get back to a basic feature. We've learned about Props, which enable us
to "receive" information from a parent component by adding that information as
attributes. We've gone this far without addressing how to make our components
handle HTML *within* them, or contained as children.

As we explored when talking about _Props_, components are "define once, re-use
many times" bits of code. Often, it's useful for a component to "wrap around"
other HTML, or contain other HTML. For example, a stylized button component
might wrap around text, or a stylish "modal dialog" component would wrap around
paragraphs and other arbitrary HTML content. You can thus imagine the button or
modal in these examples as having "empty spots" or _slots_ where this content
would go. That is to say, the component is a sort of "empty picture fancy", and
the web developer using the component would be able to "slide content" into the
frame's empty slot.

_Slots_ allow there to be "empty spots" in your HTML that proceed to get filled
by arbitrary content supplied when your component is used. Adding a slot is as
simple as including a `<slot></slot>` HTML element in your component's
_Template_ definition. To fill up a _slot_ with HTML content, add the content
between the opening and closing tags of your HTML element.

Here's an example of both, has a slot inside a div:

```html
<div class="fancy-frame">
    <slot></slot>
</div>
<!-- USAGE: -->
<x-PictureFrame>
    <p>My cat:</p>
    <img src="./cat.jpg" />
</x-PictureFrame>
```



When the component is rendered on the page, the slot gets filled with the img
tag and a p tag:

```html
<x-PictureFrame>
    <div class="fancy-frame">
        <slot>
            <p>My cat:</p>
            <img src="./cat.jpg" />
        </slot>
    </div>
</x-PictureFrame>
```


> **Ergonomics** - When designing components, and making decisions like using
> "Props" vs "slots", keep in mind who is going to use the component. If it's
> yourself, what is easy for you? If months from now, after you forget
> everything, what code would you be able to understand more simpily? If it's
> a team member, what is easiest for them?  If it's an open source project,
> what would people who have used similar projects expect?

### Why not just use _Props_?

Sometimes _Props_ and _slots_ are both options. For example, rewriting the
above:

```html
<div class="fancy-frame">
    {{ props.content|safe }}
</div>
<!-- USAGE: -->
<x-PictureFrame content="
    <p>My cat:</p>
    <img src='./cat.jpg' />
"></x-PictureFrame>
```

This could be a good solution for some things. However, in some cases, CSS will
behave differently (see next section on *Shadow DOM*), and in other cases, it
simply saves time for future users of your components (including yourself!) 
to put content "within" an element, since it makes it behave and "feel" more
like other HTML elements, and you don't have to worry about syntax issues like
nesting quotes.

### Slot features

Read the following list for a summary of the features and exact behavior of
slots. Modulo's behavior is intended to mirror the HTML spec as closely as
possibly:

- **Slots** - placeholder elements like `<slot></slot>`
- **Filling slots** - when the element renders, it moves its
  *original children* into its slots
- **Defaults** - Specify default content inside of slot e.g.:
  `<slot><em>None</em></slot>`
- **Multiple slots** / **named slots** - slots can get a name attribute,
  e.g. following HTML spec: `<slot name="artbody"></slot>`
- **Filling named slots** - Slots are filled with `slot` attribute in children,
  e.g. following HTML spec: `<div slot="artbody">...</div>`
- **Slots accumulate** - They do not "replace", so you can do `slot=` multiple
  times


##### Try it now

Examine the following two examples of slots and then follow the **local file
challenge** below.

###### Example #1: Slots and Props

```modulo_demo_example
<Props
    image
></Props>
<Template>
    <div class="fancy-frame">
        <img src="{{ props.image }}" />
        <slot><em>No caption provided.</em></slot>
    </div>
</Template>
<Style>
    :host {
        text-align: center;
    }
    img {
        height: 50px;
        width: 50px;
    }
    .fancy-frame {
        display: inline-block;
        border: 10px inset salmon;
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
        width: 100px;
        background: pink;
    }
</Style>
<!--%%% PictureFrame %%%-->
<x-PictureFrame image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Hippo_walking.jpg/320px-Hippo_walking.jpg">
    <p><em>Caption:</em> The Return of the Hippo</p>
</x-PictureFrame>
```

- *Hint:* To better examine the above sample code, try flipping to "USAGE"
  editing mode (go to MENU button above RUN, then toggle EDIT USAGE). Do you
  see the caption is the "content" of the tag? What happens when you don't
  specify any content (i.e. what's the "default")?

###### Example #2: Named Slots


```modulo_demo_example
<Props
    image
></Props>
<Template>
    <div class="fancy-frame">
        <slot name="pic">
            <em>No Image Provided</em>
        </slot>
        <slot><em>No caption provided.</em></slot>
    </div>
</Template>
<Style>
    :host {
        text-align: center;
    }
    .fancy-frame {
        display: inline-block;
        border: 10px inset salmon;
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
        width: 100px;
        background: pink;
    }
</Style>
<!--%%% PictureFrame %%%-->
<x-PictureFrame>
    <p><em>Caption:</em> The Return of the Hippo</p>
    <img
        slot="pic"
        style="width: 50px; height: 50px"
        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Hippo_walking.jpg/320px-Hippo_walking.jpg"
    />
</x-PictureFrame>
```


- *Hint:* To better examine the above sample code, try flipping to "USAGE"
  editing mode (go to MENU button above RUN, then toggle EDIT USAGE). Do you
  see how there are multiple slots in use this time? How did we specify a slot
  for the `img`?

- *Bonus Question:* Why is width and height "hard-coded" into a `style=`
  attribute in this second example? 
    - CSS in the Component _does not_ affect elements in the slots. The very
      next section of this tutorial is on _Shadow DOM_, which will explain why.

##### Try it now


1.  **Local file challenge:** Edit one of your components to have a slot by
adding an empty `<slot></slot>` placeholder element in your HTML.
2.  Edit your usage to include text or other HTML tags between your opening and
closing tags to "fill" the slot
3. Extra: Practice the other features of slot, such as using named slots.

## Intro to render mode

Yet another feature of Modulo that is useful to know is component render mode.
Each component render mode selects a different CSS isolation.  It will also
change DOM behavior, so have even more tools to write powerful, ergonomic, and
efficient components.

### CSS Leakage

Now that we have covered the ways for components to receive children, it's
important to think about how CSS gets isolated, since we start to run into
pitfalls where "parent" CSS "leaks" into "child" CSS.  As was established in
the first part, `<Style>` components "isolate" themselves by "prefixing" all
CSS with the component name. 

### Default isolation (regular)

For an example, examine the following two snippets of code:

```css
p { font-size: 1.3rem; }
em.special { color: blue; }
/* ..."prefixing" causes it to turn into... */
x-MyComponent p { font-size: 1.3rem; }
x-MyComponent em.special { color: blue; }
```

This ensures that the `p` tags selected will only be contained within
`x-MyComponent`. This prevents CSS from "leaking" into other components, and
makes websites much easier to maintain, without causing CSS classes to get
messy and convoluted.  This brings us to the default mode for _Component_
definitions in Modulo: "regular" mode.


#### Details

Component will render to the screen, CSS will be prefixed as described above.
This mode is often what web designers expect when writing CSS: They want it to
be "silo'ed", but not _too_ strictly.  In general, it's not that often you need
to specify anything other than the default rendering mode, but when you do need
to use them, they can be super handy in fixing CSS bugs, so let's review them
now.


## Beyond "regular"

There is still a lot of potential for leakage. For example, external, global
styles can "leak" *into* the component. Similarly, the component's styles can
"leak" *into* it's children, e.g. children created with _slots_ or _Props_.

This is one of the uses of _Component_ render modes, and their accompanying
_Style_ isolation modes: You can isolate your CSS with one of 2 techniques:
*class*-based ("vanish") and *shadow*-based isolation.

### mode="vanish"

> **How does vanish work?**- How can CSS still select, when the component
> "vanishes" from the DOM? Well, the "secret to the vanishing act" is that
> after that first render, the _Style_ CPart attaches the class to all
> sub-elements that are referenced in CSS.

When `<Component mode="vanish">` is activated, then the _Style_ CPart switch to
`isolate="class"`, or class-based isolation. This behaves similarly to prefix
based, but ends up having a few important differences.  First, and most
importantly, `mode="vanish"` will cause the Component to vanish after
rendering, or remove itself from the DOM. This means that it cannot ever
"rerender": Vanishing components are one-time things, and if the parent
component rerenders, the old vanishing component will be destroyed and rebuilt
again.

Second, class-based isolation will rewrite your CSS like the following:

```css
div > h1 { font-size: 2.3rem; }
a.special:hover { color: orange; }
/* ..."vanish + class isolation" causes it to turn into... */
.MyComponent:is(div > h1) { font-size: 2.3rem; }
.MyComponent:is(a.special:hover) { color: orange; }
```

This CSS will *not* affect children, but the CSS will "stop" at the immediately
rendered template. Thus, "vanish" and class-based isolation isolates in one
direction: Parent to children.  Another big difference is since mode="vanish"
removes the Component `:host` selector changes behavior. Instead, it will match
all children, so you can still use it for CSS variables.


### mode="shadow"

When `<Component mode="shadow">` is activated, then the component switches to
using a somewhat new feature of HTML: the Shadow DOM. This dramatically named
feature allows a Web Component to create a protected or hidden DOM fragment
(e.g. portion of an HTML page) that can be manipulated, while "protecting it"
from outside CSS. Like vanish, this will dramatically change how the component
renders, since the browser will treat it quite differently, and all of it's
children will be "removed" from the DOM in the hidden Shadow DOM, making it
appear "empty" when inspected (but with more clicking, you can find the "shadow
root" where the hidden content is).

When a component is in shadow mode, and you launch your site or build your
site, it's CSS *will NOT* be put into the main CSS file. That means that it
will be stored in the JavaScript file and only added whenever that component
appears on the screen.

Furthermore, due to the what the browser works, the CSS will be fully isolated
in both directions: Outside CSS won't affect your component's children, and
inner CSS is incapable of affecting anythign else, and won't even be added
until the component gets on the screen. Since it's fully isolated, there is no
need to prefix, so CSS will be inserted as is.

1. Examine the following demo of a "Shadow DOM" slot-based component, and then
answer the questions below.

```modulo_demo_example

        background: pink;
    }
    slot:first-child { /* slots can be styled like any HTML element */
        overflow: hidden;
        max-height: 50px;

    />
</x-PictureFrame>
```

2. **Local file challenge:** Try each of the different component modes and CSS
isolation features on your local file.


##### Comprehension Questions


- Why does the width and height in the CSS not apply to the img?
    - **ANSWER:** CSS in the Component _does not_ affect elements in the slots.
    - **Explanation:** The component is using "shadow DOM" to make it ONLY
      apply to stuff within the component, but not in it's slots. You can
      confirm this by going into "Inspect", and seeing how the `img` tag is
      indeed outside of the `shadowRoot`. By default, when a component is in
      shadow mode, it will only apply it's CSS to it's "own" elements (e.g. not
      slotted).

- How is this useful?
    - **ANSWER:** You can write CSS that only affects what's in the component,
      making it better isolated
    - **Explanation:** This is another important difference between _slots_ and
      using HTML strings (e.g. via Props): Slots are easier to isolate with
      CSS.

- How does the default isolation mode (*prefix* isolation) affect this?
    - **ANSWER:** If you don't specify `mode=shadow` or `mode=vanish`, the
      default behavior _will_ apply it's CSS to slot content! Often that _is_
      desired, in fact (e.g. a modal component that neatly styles it's
      content)
    - **Explanation:** Only in *shadow* (what's used by the modulo website) and
      *class* (vanish) isolation modes, it will isolate it's slots.

# Events

> **How many events are there?** There are many, many events! We'll mostly just
> use `click`, but sometimes you'll need other events, such as when adding
> interactions for mouse motion, or adding in drag-and-drop. [Read MDN's list
> of all
> events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#event_listing).



Now for perhaps the most important framework feature for interactive
applications: Attaching events. In Modulo, events are attached with the _event
directive_, indicated by the `@` sign.

## The event directive

So far, we've learned how to use `[state.bind]` to add interactivity to a
Component.   Under the hood, `[state.bind]` attaches something called an "event
listener". This is a bit of JavaScript code that waits for user interaction.
The _State_ CPart waits for the `keyup` event (e.g. when typing in an input) or
the `change` event (e.g. when adjusting a slider).  This is good enough for a
lot of cases, but often we want to listen to other sorts of events.  There are
also events for clicking, mouse motion, scrolling, resizing, and so on. These
are "activated" or "triggered" by the web browser when a user of your web site
does one of these actions (types on the keyboard, moves the mouse, etc.). We'll
need to use event directives to access these other events.

The most used event is the `click` event. Here's an example a click event:

```
<Template>
    <button @click:=state.items.reverse>
        Reverse the items!
    </button>
</Template>
<State
    items:='[ "a", "b", "c" ]'
></State>
```


> **Method? What methods are there?** All "container" types of data have
> different "verbs" or "commands" you can do to it, which are called "methods".
> For example, just like you can reverse a line of people in real life by
> giving the command for everyone to turn around (so to speak), you can reverse
> an Array of people's names by giving the `Array.reverse` command. These
> enable different modifications to happen to the data contained within. By
> default, JavaScript comes with several very handy ones attached to the
> `Array` type, and we'll go over them all in this tutorial.  However, for a
> full reference, you can refer to MDN's documentation:
> [Array tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays),
> [Full list of Array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)


Let's break down the event directive in  detail:

- `@click` - all event directives start with `@`, so `@click`, `@mouseover`,
  `@drag` etc.
- `:=` - this is a data prop directive, which allows us to access `state.items`
- `state.items.reverse` - this is accessing the `items` Array, and then on
  that, accessing the `Array.reverse` method, which will get activated when the
  `click` event happens

Just guessing, based on the text and the code you see here, what do you think
this might do when a user clicks on the button? If you guessed it might
"reverse" the state variable called "items", you would be correct!

Let's now try it out.

##### Try it now

1. Examine the following code, and try the demo. What does clicking the button
do?

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <p>Items: {{ state.items|join }}</p>
    <button
        @click:=state.items.reverse 
    >Reverse the items!</button>
</Template>
<State
    items:='[ "candy", "bread" ]'
></State>
```


2. Examine the following code, and try the demo. What does each button do?

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <p>Items: {{ state.items|join }}</p>
    <hr />
    Remove last:
    <button @click:=state.items.pop>Array.pop</button>
    <hr />
    Remove first:
    <button @click:=state.items.shift>Array.shift</button>
</Template>
<State
    items:='[ "zucchini", "oatmeal", "oranges", "apples", "candy", "bread" ]'
></State>
```


##### Comprehension Questions

Do you see how clicking on the buttons causes the Array to be reversed or
removed or otherwise modified, and the component to rerender with the new look?
Why do you think the component needs to "rerender"?

- Answer: Modulo is based on a "change state & rerender" philosophy. That is,
  when you do an event, that should change the state, and then the component
  will automatically rerender, showing the new appearance based on the new
  values in the state. In this case, it's reversing the list.

-----------

## Event payload

Many methods that we want to activate upon an event require extra information
about the event to be useful. This extra data is added with a "payload="
attribute.  For example, this button will activate the `Array.fill` method with
a payload of `"X"``:

```
<button
    @click:=state.brands.fill
    payload="X"
>Change to "X"</button>
```

This causes the "brands" Array to get each item replaced with the String `"X"`.
Payloads can also have data props, so you can use different values, e.g. if you
wanted a number type, you'd write `payload:=0`

*Let's practice events and payload by building up a shopping list app, which
will use several Array methods, and many click events.*


##### Try it now

1. Examine the following example, that transforms our shopping list to
something a bit less "balanced":

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <p>Shopping list: {{ state.items|join }}</p>
    <hr />
    <button
        @click:=state.items.fill
        payload="CANDY!!!!!!"
    >MAKE IT ALL CANDY!!</button>
</Template>
<State
    items:='[ "zucchini", "oatmeal", "oranges", "apples", "candy", "bread" ]'
></State>
```

2. Now, examine this next app, which offers the user two options to "push"
(add) onto a Array that starts empty:

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <p>Shopping list: {{ state.items|join }}</p>
    <hr />
    <button
        @click:=state.items.push
        payload="oatmeal"
    >Oatmeal</button>
    <button
        @click:=state.items.push
        payload="CANDY!!!"
    >Candy</button>
</Template>
<State
    items:=[]
></State>
```

3. Examine the following code. It's more advanced. It has a list of different
items, which it uses to generate the different buttons with different items:


```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <h3>Shopping list | {{ state.items|length }}</h3>
    <p>{{ state.items|join }}</p>
    <hr />
    {% for favorite in state.favorites %}
        <button
            @click:=state.items.push
            payload="{{ favorite }}"
        >{{ favorite|capfirst }}</button>
    {% endfor %}
</Template>
<State
    items:=[]
    favorites:='[ "zucchini", "oatmeal", "oranges", "apples", "candy", "bread" ]'
></State>
```


4. Examine this next code. In this iteration, the same technique is reapplied
to adding to this "item favorites" list. You can think of it as two shopping
lists: The list itself and favorites, where the user adds to favorites, and
favorites adds to the shopping list.


```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <h3>Shopping list | {{ state.items|length }}</h3>
    <p>{{ state.items|join }}</p>
    <hr />
    <h4>Favorites</h4>
    {% for favorite in state.favorites %}
        <button
            @click:=state.items.push
            payload="{{ favorite }}"
        >{{ favorite|capfirst }}</button>
    {% endfor %}
    <hr />
    <input
        [state.bind] name="text"
        style="width: 60%"
    />
    <button
        @click:=state.favorites.push
        payload="{{ state.text }}"
    >+</button>
</Template>
<State
    items:=[]
    favorites:='[ "oatmeal" ]'
    text=""
></State>
```


##### Usability

This next iteration on the code will be bigger.


This section mentioned "ergonomics" earlier, though from a coder or designer
perspective. Perhaps it's very obvious, but the more important ergonomics is
that the page itself is usable, and users (e.g. non-coders, website visitors,
etc using the page) can understand how to use the app from a user perspective.

For this last set of tweaks, we'll learn HTML and Modulo features that make it
easier to write more pleasant applications.  First, we'll use a feature of
HTML: The `placeholder="Add to favorites"` attribute, that lets us add a
"default placeholder" in HTML.  Then, we'll use the Modulo template tag `{%
empty %}` to our `{% for %}` loop for a user-friendly message when we have an
empty list.  Finally, we'll add two if-statements: One to stop empty text, and
the to warn users trying to add duplicates. For simplicity, we'll just use the
browser's built-in tooltip with a `title="..."` attribute on an HTML
abbreviation tag (`abbr`).

Examine the following final code transformation:

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <h3>Shopping list | {{ state.items|length }}</h3>
    <p>{{ state.items|join }}</p>
    <hr />
    <h4>Favorites</h4>
    {% for favorite in state.favorites %}
        <button
            @click:=state.items.push
            payload="{{ favorite }}"
        >{{ favorite|capfirst }}</button>
    {% empty %}
        <em>(None yet! Use form below.)</em>
    {% endfor %}
    <hr />
    <input
        [state.bind] name="text"
        placeholder="Add to favorites"
        style="width: 60%"
    />
    {% if state.text %}
        {% if state.text not in state.favorites %}
            <button
                @click:=state.favorites.push
                payload="{{ state.text }}"
            >+</button>
        {% else %}
            <abbr title="{{ state.text }} already in favorites.">
                [ ! ]
            </abbr>
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
</Template>
<State
    items:=[]
    favorites:='[]'
    text=""
></State>
```




##### Comprehension Question

What good are click events for?

- Answer: Most interactive applications rely on click events to have user interactivity via mouse.

Lastly, in our *Ramping Up* tutorial, it was mentioned it would end with a
little peak into JavaScript.  If you are a total newbie when it comes to
JavaScript, this last section might make less sense. However, still consider
looking over it -- maybe you might find you like JavaScript, and could get
curious to learn more. With JavaScript code, you can greatly expand what you
can do with Modulo with custom functionality, create more interactive
applications, games, better integrating APIs, process data, and more.

While Modulo is designed to be a handy little tool for web developers even
without use of embedded JavaScript or _Script_ parts, sometimes you just need
access to that extra power of custom JavaScript code.

##### Learning Tips

* **Tip 1:** When developing with Modulo, especially if you are working with
  JavaScript, remember to keep your JavaScript Console open, so you know if
  there are errors!

* **Tip 2:** This tutorial only covers a tiny bit of how to add some JavaScript
  to your page. It does not go into much detail about the language. For this,
  consider a different tutorial, such as [MDN's JavaScript
  Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics),
  [MDN's Learn JavaScript tutorial
  collection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript), or [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/).

<!--We can deduce two things about this guessing game component. Deduction One:
It used a _State_ CPart. We know that it used a _State_ CPart because it
changes or mutates. Without a _State_ CPart, a component cannot "change state",
or mutate or have dynamic content, and instead will be rendered the same way
every time (that is, assuming it has the same _Props_). In other words, if a
component needs to have dynamic content or change over time, then a _State_
CPart is necessary to store this dynamic content. Now on to Deduction Two: It
used a _Script_ CPart. Script CParts allow for complicated interactions and new
behavior to be developed. Unfortunately, anything as complicated as this game
logic requires a background in JavaScript to accomplish, meaning we will not
cover the behavior in this tutorial.  However, if you are familiar with
JavaScript, feel free to examine the [demo source code on the examples
page](/examples/) to see how it works yourself!-->



## The Script CPart


To add JavaScript, use the _Script_ CPart. This CPart will execute the JS code
contained within once, immediately upon loading the component. See this
example:

```
<Script>
    console.log("Hello JavaScript world!");
/Script>
```

> **Event directives in detail** Let's break down the event directive once
> again: `@click:=script.sayHello`. First, note the at-sign: `@`. This is
> "syntactic sugar" for the `[component.event]` directive. This will attach a
> "click" event listener to the given element when that element is first
> mounted (i.e.  displayed on the screen), and remove the listener if it
> leaves. In this case, we are using a `:=` style "data prop" style assignment,
> to assign the click event to point to the sayHello function of the _Script_
> CPart. All functions defined in a _Script_ CPart will automatically be
> "exported" and available to click events, or in dataprops in general.


In this above example, the _Script_ CPart will execute that JS code once, as
soon as it's loaded, causing the "console.log" to log that message to the web
browser's Developer Tools JavaScript Console exactly once.


### Attaching click events

Typically, it's more useful to execute code when a user performs an action. To
do this, we must place the "console.log" into a function:

```
<Script>
    function sayHello() {
        console.log("Hello JavaScript world!");
    }
/Script>
```

Then, attach a "click" event directive to a HTML tag, such as, for example, a
button element:

```
<button @click:=script.sayHello>Click me</button>
```

Now, whenever a user clicks on the button, it will run the "sayHello" function,
logging the text into the JavaScript console.



##### Try it now

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <button @click:="script.doLog">console.log a message</button>
</Template>
<Script>
    console.log("COMPONENT GOT LOADED!");
    function doLog() {
        console.log("Hello Modulo Scripting World!");
    }
/Script>
```

1.  Bring up the console: Press `Control+Shift+J` (Linux, Windows) or
`Command+Option+J` (macOS) on your keyboard to open the Console. Alternatively,
you can right-click with your mouse and select "Inspect", and then go to the
_Console_ tab.
2.  Do you see the "COMPONENT GOT LOADED!" text displayed in the console? It is
displayed once every time the component is loaded. By clicking "RUN", you can
"reload" the component, causing that message to show (or count up) again.
3.  Try now clicking on the button in the preview on the right. Do you see how
every time you click it shows (or counts) the text of the console.log in the
console?
4.  _Extra:_ Any number of functions can be defined in a _Script_ CPart.
Practice writing your own function that console logs a different message, and
then attaching it to a new button (or the existing button).
5.  _Extra:_ The "event" directive supports any event. Try changing "@click" to
"@mouseover", and then move your mouse over the button (without clicking).

### Interacting with state

The _Script_ CPart is like the _Template_ CPart in one way: You get variables
referencing the other CParts. Within functions defined in the _Script_ CPart,
variables will be available representing the other CParts that have been
defined in the _Component_. As with the _Template_ CPart, the most useful
variables are `state`, with the current data in _State_ CPart (the "data"
Object), and `props`, with the value of the attributes that were passed to this
component.

Remember our "Holmes-style" detective work we did in the previous section? We
looked at a button which incremented a value when clicked. The JavaScript code
to increment a variable is `num++`, and for state data it can be:
`state.num++`.  Also, by default, components will rerender after every event
that you are listening to. With that in mind, examine the code of the Hello
button:


```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <button @click:="script.doCountup">Hello {{ state.num }}</button>
</Template>
<State
    num:=42
></State>
<Script>
    function doCountup() {
        state.num++;
    }
/Script>
```

By clicking on the button, it will increment the state value. Since the
component will rerender after the click, it will then change the DOM to show
the new number.

With the power of JavaScript, you can do all manner of things with the Script
tag. The [Examples page](/examples/) has all sorts of examples of more
complicated apps and applications. The typical use of a Script tag, thus, is to
create custom logic that manipulates or "puppets" the state, which in turn is
what controls the rendering of the component's HTML code by the Template CPart.

Keep in mind that the Script CPart is intended to be limited. Serious
JavaScript development should be split into separate JS files, or defined as
custom CParts. Thus, think of the Script CPart as more "filling in the gaps"
between CParts, which should do most of the heavy lifting (e.g. asynchronous
code, complicated API calls or data transformation, etc).


##### Try it now

See if you can understand how this classic To-Do app operates, which interacts
with state in two different ways (clearing an input, and pushing to a list).

```modulo_demo
<!-- The classic "To-Do" app in Modulo. The State CPart "binds" the input
so it can be to be cleared or retrieved, and keeps track of the list. -->
<Template>
<ol>
    {% for item in state.list %}
        <li>{{ item }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    <li>
        <input [state.bind] name="text" />
        <button @click:=script.addItem>Add</button>
    </li>
</ol>
</Template>

<State
    list:='["Milk", "Bread", "Candy"]'
    text="Coffee"
></State>

<Script>
    function addItem() {
        state.list.push(state.text); // add to list
        state.text = ""; // clear input
    }
/Script>
```

##### Comprehension Question

This To-Do app could be done without a _Script_ tag - we were building similar
apps just before adding events that went directly to `state.list.push`. Why
would you choose one over the other?

- **Answer:** As with other questions - whatever is easiest! Typically, avoid
  using a _Script_ until you have to, since this requires a lot more care,
  since it's more flexible than just directly attaching an event, and thus has
  more opportunities for bugs or confusing code. Often, you might encounter
  something that cannot be done directly. Then, that's time for the _Script_
  CPart and custom JavaScript.

## Custom Directives

**New to JavaScript?** You probably won't have much need for this. Feel free to
skip this last section!


> **DOM Methods? What DOM methods are there?** All "DOM elements" (p, h1, etc)
> also have methods or different "verbs" or "commands" you can do to it.
> These enable different direct modifications to the DOM, and are how Modulo
> itself implements many of its features.  Typically, you should just use
> Templating, and only do direct DOM manipulation as a last resort.  However,
> for a full reference, you can refer to MDN's documentation:
> [DOM Introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction),
> [DOM-Node reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node)

Sometimes you want to have the full, precise control of the browser's
collecting of built-in DOM methods, and you want to be able to directly modify
the browser's DOM (document structure), at certain spots in your component.
This is where writing your own directives comes into play.  All the directives
built-in directives (state.bind, events, and data props), all are built using
JS functions or methods that activate when certain attributes are found on the
document. You can leverage the same system for your own to do similar direct
DOM manipulation (e.g. attaching events or manually modifying its content).

For example, examine the following code:

```
<div [script.ready]>
    Hey!
</div>
```

Note how in the same format as `[state.bind]`, we wrote `[script.ready]`.
This will invoke the corresponding `readyMount` function when the element
appears, and `readyUnmount` when it is removed from the page:

```javascript
function readyMount({ el }) {
    console.log('The element is ready:', el);
    el.innerHTML = '<h1>Hello DOM world!</h1>';
}
function readyUnmount({ el }) {
    console.log('The element is about to go away:', el);
}
```

Note that the naming is important: the directive name must be all lowercase,
and the function must end with either `Mount` or `Unmount`.


##### Try it now

One common use of directives might be to focus a particular input. Try
uncommenting the `el.focus()` line of code (that is, removing the `//`
prefixing it), and see what happens when you click RUN:

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <label>Top: <input  /></label>
    <label>Middle: <input [script.focus] /></label>
    <label>Bottom: <input  /></label>
</Template>

<Script>
    function focusMount({ el }) {
        el.value = 'Ready to type:';
        // el.focus();
    }
/Script>
```


##### Comprehension Question

What are uses of custom directives?

- **Answer:** When core Modulo features are not enough, and you need to
  directly use the browser's DOM methods.

When you should do direct DOM manipulation with directives?

- **Answer:** Only do direct DOM manipulation as a last resort, such as when
  you are following a tutorial that gives instructions this way, or are
  combining Modulo with another framework that operates with direct DOM
  references

# Part 4: Summary


We learned about Shadow DOM and isolating CSS from children using slots. We
learned about events, and how to attach various operations to click events.  We
learned a little bit about attaching JavaScript-powered script tags to our
components, and then activating functions via either events or directives.


#### Key terms

* **slot** - A placeholder for content to be inserted when a component is used.
  Useful for writing components that "wrap around" other content.
* **Style isolation** - The _Style_ CPart has several "strategies" or modes for
  isolating the CSS it contains to prevent it from affecting other  components
  in ways you do not intend
* **Component mode** - A way to set components to render in a certain way,
  automatically setting Style to isolate in a certain way as well
    * **mode="vanish"** - A way to make the component "vanish" after rendering,
      and make the Style use classes instead of prefixes
    * **mode="shadow"** - A browser-enforced way to isolate CSS to a component
      so it can't affect other CSS and other CSS can't affect it
* **Events** - Browsers generate events constantly when users interact with the page
* **Event listening** - Listen to events to activate certain methods when they occur 
* **methods** - All types of data has "methods" attached to it, enabling different modifcaations to happen
* **Script** - CPart that enables embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code, and
  allowing for easy access to CPart interface, and exposing JS functions to be
  attached as events
* **Directive** - A special type of HTML attribute that "hooks in"
  functionality to otherwise plain HTML elements. 
    - @click (shortcut for [component.event]) - attach event listener to element
    - [script.dostuff] - custom defined directives for accessing DOM API directly
