tutorial: Part 3
---


In Part 3 of this tutorial, we start by revisiting our `<Component>` and
`<Style>` definitions in learning about _Shadow DOM_, slots, and the
corresponding CSS isolation modes.  We'll learn how to use Template Tags, to
optionally include various salient (or non-salient) portions of our HTML
templates, to create things like accordian controls, or modals that toggle
their visibility.




# Slots

## Introduction to shadow DOM, slots, and CSS isolation

This section introduces 3 important terms: _shadow DOM_, _slots_, and _CSS
isolation_. These are used here to describe the way Modulo exposes these
built-in browser features. This section is also not needed for some Modulo
users, so if you are in a hurry and don't think more fine-grained CSS and HTML
composition tools are important to you right now, [feel free to skip down to
_Template Tags_ section](#templatetags), and come back when you hit a wall with
isolating CSS or following best practices with _Component_ design.

As a general note, it's important to know that Modulo attempts to immitate and
extend the browser standard, rather than work against it. That means that
"slots" work more or less the same as the browser's built-in concept of slots,
but Modulo makes it easier to use and declare them without use of additional
JavaScript, and also lets them get applied to components that don't use shadow
DOM.

## Putting elements into slots

> **The origin of slots** Slots are a feature of the "shadow DOM", a new-ish
> feature of web browsers. Modulo replicates the same behavior of these
> "shadow" slots, making slots even easier to use without JavaScript.

Let's get back to a basic feature. We've learned about Props, which enable us
to "receive" information from the HTML page (or a parent component) by adding
that information as attributes. We've gone this far without addressing how to
make our components handle HTML *within* them, or contained as children.

As we explored when talking about _Props_, components are "define once, re-use
many times" bits of code. Often, it's useful for a component to "wrap around"
other HTML, or contain other HTML. For example, a stylized button component
might wrap around text, or a stylish "modal dialog" component would wrap around
paragraphs and other arbitrary HTML content. You can thus imagine the button or
modal in these examples as having "empty spots" or _slots_ where this content
would go. That is to say, the component is a sort of "empty picture fancy", and
the web developer using the component would be able to "slide content" into the
frame's empty slot.

_Slots_ allow there to be "empty spots" in your HTML that proceed to get filled
by arbitrary content supplied when your component is used. Adding a slot is as
simple as including a `<slot></slot>` HTML element in your component's
_Template_ definition. To fill up a _slot_ with HTML content, add the content
between the opening and closing tags of your HTML element.

Here's an example of both, has a slot inside a div:

```html
<!-- COMPONENT TEMPLATE: -->
<div class="fancy-frame">
    <slot></slot>
</div>
<!-- USAGE: -->
<x-PictureFrame>
    <p>My cat:</p>
    <img src="./cat.jpg" />
</x-PictureFrame>
```



When the component is rendered on the page, the slot gets filled with the img
tag and a p tag:

```html
<x-PictureFrame>
    <div class="fancy-frame">
        <slot>
            <p>My cat:</p>
            <img src="./cat.jpg" />
        </slot>
    </div>
</x-PictureFrame>
```


> **Ergonomics** - When designing components, and making decisions like using
> "Props" vs "slots", keep in mind who is going to use the component. If it's
> yourself, what is easy for you? If months from now, after you forget
> everything, what code would you be able to understand more simpily? If it's a
> team member, what is easiest for them?  If it's an open source project, what
> would people who have used similar projects expect?

### Why not just use _Props_?

Sometimes _Props_ and _slots_ are both options. For example, rewriting the
above:

```html
<!-- COMPONENT TEMPLATE: -->
<div class="fancy-frame">
    {{ props.content|safe }}
</div>
<!-- USAGE: -->
<x-PictureFrame content="
    <p>My cat:</p>
    <img src='./cat.jpg' />
"></x-PictureFrame>
```

This could be a good solution for some things. In some cases, it may behave
identically, or be desirable for it's simplicity.  However, in other cases, CSS
will behave differently (see next section on *Shadow DOM*), and in other cases,
it simply saves time for future users of your components (including yourself!)
to put content "within" an element, since it makes it behave and "feel" more
like other HTML elements, and you don't have to worry about syntax issues like
nesting quotes.

### Slot features

Read the following list for a summary of the features and exact behavior of
slots. Modulo's behavior is intended to mirror the HTML spec as closely as
possibly:

- **Slots** - placeholder elements like `<slot></slot>`
- **Filling slots** - when the element renders, it moves its
  *original children* into its slots
- **Defaults** - Specify default content inside of slot e.g.:
  `<slot><em>None</em></slot>`
- **Multiple slots** / **named slots** - slots can get a name attribute,
  e.g. following HTML spec: `<slot name="artbody"></slot>`
- **Filling named slots** - Slots are filled with `slot` attribute in children,
  e.g. following HTML spec: `<div slot="artbody">...</div>`
- **Slots accumulate** - They do not "replace", so you can do `slot=` multiple
  times


##### Try it now

Examine the following two examples of slots and then follow the **local file
challenge** below.

###### Example #1: Slots and Props

```modulo_demo_example
<Props
    image
></Props>
<Template>
    <div class="fancy-frame">
        <img src="{{ props.image }}" />
        <slot><em>No caption provided.</em></slot>
    </div>
</Template>
<Style>
    :host {
        text-align: center;
    }
    img {
        height: 50px;
        width: 50px;
    }
    .fancy-frame {
        display: inline-block;
        border: 10px inset salmon;
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
        width: 100px;
        background: pink;
    }
</Style>
<!--%%% PictureFrame %%%-->
<x-PictureFrame image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Hippo_walking.jpg/320px-Hippo_walking.jpg">
    <p><em>Caption:</em> The Return of the Hippo</p>
</x-PictureFrame>
```

- *Hint:* To better examine the above sample code, try flipping to "USAGE"
  editing mode (go to MENU button above RUN, then toggle EDIT USAGE). Do you
  see the caption is the "content" of the tag? What happens when you don't
  specify any content (i.e. what's the "default")?

###### Example #2: Named Slots


```modulo_demo_example
<Props
    image
></Props>
<Template>
    <div class="fancy-frame">
        <slot name="pic">
            <em>No Image Provided</em>
        </slot>
        <slot><em>No caption provided.</em></slot>
    </div>
</Template>
<Style>
    :host {
        text-align: center;
    }
    .fancy-frame {
        display: inline-block;
        border: 10px inset salmon;
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
        width: 100px;
        background: pink;
    }
</Style>
<!--%%% PictureFrame %%%-->
<x-PictureFrame>
    <p><em>Caption:</em> The Return of the Hippo</p>
    <img
        slot="pic"
        style="width: 50px; height: 50px"
        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Hippo_walking.jpg/320px-Hippo_walking.jpg"
    />
</x-PictureFrame>
```


- *Hint:* To better examine the above sample code, try flipping to "USAGE"
  editing mode (go to MENU button above RUN, then toggle EDIT USAGE). Do you
  see how there are multiple slots in use this time? How did we specify a slot
  for the `img`?

- *Bonus Question:* Why is width and height "hard-coded" into a `style=`
  attribute in this second example? 
    - CSS in the Component _does not_ affect elements in the slots. The very
      next section of this tutorial is on _Shadow DOM_, which will explain why.

##### Try it now


1.  **Local file challenge:** Edit one of your components to have a slot by
adding an empty `<slot></slot>` placeholder element in your HTML.
2.  Edit your usage to include text or other HTML tags between your opening and
closing tags to "fill" the slot
3. Extra: Practice the other features of slot, such as using named slots.

# CSS Isolation

## Intro to render mode

Yet another feature of Modulo that is useful to know is component render mode.
Each component render mode selects a different CSS isolation.  It will also
change DOM behavior, so have even more tools to write powerful, ergonomic, and
efficient components.

### CSS Leakage

Now that we have covered the ways for components to receive children, it's
important to think about how CSS gets isolated, since we start to run into
pitfalls where "parent" CSS "leaks" into "child" CSS.  As was established in
the first part, `<Style>` components "isolate" themselves by "prefixing" all
CSS with the component name. 

### Default isolation (regular)

For an example, examine the following two snippets of code:

```css
p { font-size: 1.3rem; }
em.special { color: blue; }
/* ..."prefixing" causes it to turn into... */
x-MyComponent p { font-size: 1.3rem; }
x-MyComponent em.special { color: blue; }
```

This ensures that the `p` tags selected will only be contained within
`x-MyComponent`. This prevents CSS from "leaking" into other components, and
makes websites much easier to maintain, without causing CSS classes to get
messy and convoluted.  This brings us to the default mode for _Component_
definitions in Modulo: "regular" mode.


#### Details

Component will render to the screen, CSS will be prefixed as described above.
This mode is often what web designers expect when writing CSS: They want it to
be "silo'ed", but not _too_ strictly. That is why it is the default.

In general, it's not that often you need to specify anything other than the
default rendering mode, but when you do need to use them, they can be super
handy in fixing CSS bugs or unruly third party CSS or scripts, so let's review
them now.


## Beyond "regular"

There is still a lot of potential for leakage. For example, external, global
styles can "leak" *into* the component. Similarly, the component's styles can
"leak" *into* it's children, e.g. children created with _slots_ or _Props_.
Often both of these are "good leakage". But sometimes, it's undesirable, and
you want more fine-graned isolation.

This is one of the uses of _Component_ render modes, and their accompanying
_Style_ isolation modes: You can isolate your CSS with one of 2 techniques:
*class*-based ("vanish") and *shadow*-based isolation. They behave differently
and will result in radically different HTML and CSS being generated.

### mode="vanish"

> **How does vanish work?**- How can CSS still select, when the component
> "vanishes" from the DOM? Well, the "secret to the vanishing act" is that
> after that first render, the _Style_ CPart attaches the class to all
> sub-elements that are referenced in CSS.

When `<Component mode="vanish">` is activated, then the _Style_ CPart switch to
`isolate="class"`, or class-based isolation. This behaves similarly to prefix
based, but ends up having a few important differences.  First, and most
importantly, `mode="vanish"` will cause the Component to vanish after
rendering, or remove itself from the DOM. This means that it cannot ever
"rerender": Vanishing components are one-time things, and if the parent
component rerenders, the old vanishing component will be destroyed and rebuilt
again.

Second, class-based isolation will rewrite your CSS like the following:

```css
div > h1 { font-size: 2.3rem; }
a.special:hover { color: orange; }
/* ..."vanish + class isolation" causes it to turn into... */
.MyComponent:is(div > h1) { font-size: 2.3rem; }
.MyComponent:is(a.special:hover) { color: orange; }
```

This CSS will *not* affect children, but the CSS will "stop" at the immediately
rendered template. Thus, "vanish" and class-based isolation isolates in one
direction: Parent to children.  Another big difference is since mode="vanish"
removes the Component `:host` selector changes behavior. Instead, it will match
all children, so you can still use it for CSS variables.


### mode="shadow"

When `<Component mode="shadow">` is activated, then the component switches to
using a somewhat new feature of HTML: the Shadow DOM. This dramatically named
feature allows a Web Component to create a protected or hidden DOM fragment
(e.g. portion of an HTML page) that can be manipulated, while "protecting it"
from outside CSS. Like vanish, this will dramatically change how the component
renders, since the browser will treat it quite differently, and all of it's
children will be "removed" from the DOM in the hidden Shadow DOM, making it
appear "empty" when inspected (but with more clicking, you can find the "shadow
root" where the hidden content is).

When a component is in shadow mode, and you launch your site or build your
site, it's CSS *will NOT* be put into the main CSS file. That means that it
will be stored in the JavaScript file and only added whenever that component
appears on the screen.

Furthermore, due to the what the browser works, the CSS will be fully isolated
in both directions: Outside CSS won't affect your component's children, and
inner CSS is incapable of affecting anythign else, and won't even be added
until the component gets on the screen. Since it's fully isolated, there is no
need to prefix, so CSS will be inserted as is.



##### Try it now

1. Examine the following demo of a "Shadow DOM" slot-based component, and then
answer the questions below.

```modulo_demo_example
<Props
    image
></Props>
<Template>
    <div class="fancy-frame">
        <slot name="pic">
            <em>No Image Provided</em>
        </slot>
        <slot><em>No caption provided.</em></slot>
    </div>
</Template>
<Style>
    /* Why does it not work?? */
    img {
        height: 50px;
        width: 50px;
    }
    :host {
        text-align: center;
    }
    .fancy-frame {
        display: inline-block;
        border: 10px inset salmon;
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
        width: 100px;
        background: pink;
    }
    slot:first-child { /* slots can be styled like any HTML element */
        overflow: hidden;
        max-height: 50px;
        display: block;
    }
</Style>
<!--%%% PictureFrame %%%-->
<x-PictureFrame>
    <p><em>Caption:</em> The Image TOO BIG</p>
    <img
        slot="pic"
        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Hippo_walking.jpg/320px-Hippo_walking.jpg"
    />
</x-PictureFrame>
```

2. **Local file challenge:** Try each of the different component modes and CSS
isolation features on your local file.


##### Comprehension Questions


- Why does the width and height in the CSS not apply to the img?
    - **ANSWER:** CSS in the Component _does not_ affect elements in the slots.
    - **Explanation:** The component is using "shadow DOM" to make it ONLY
      apply to stuff within the component, but not in it's slots. You can
      confirm this by going into "Inspect", and seeing how the `img` tag is
      indeed outside of the `shadowRoot`. By default, when a component is in
      shadow mode, it will only apply it's CSS to it's "own" elements (e.g. not
      slotted).

- How is this useful?
    - **ANSWER:** You can write CSS that only affects what's in the component,
      making it better isolated
    - **Explanation:** This is another important difference between _slots_ and
      using HTML strings (e.g. via Props): Slots are easier to isolate with
      CSS.

- How does the default isolation mode (*prefix* isolation) affect this?
    - **ANSWER:** If you don't specify `mode=shadow` or `mode=vanish`, the
      default behavior _will_ apply it's CSS to slot content! Often that _is_
      desired, in fact (e.g. a modal component that neatly styles it's
      content)
    - **Explanation:** Only in *shadow* (what's used by the modulo website) and
      *class* (vanish) isolation modes, it will isolate it's slots.

# Template Tags

> **Built-in Template Tags and Custom Template Tags** - Modulo comes with many
> template-tags pre-installed: Read [Templating Reference - Built-In
> Tags](/docs/templating/tags.html#builtintags) for examples of all
> template-tags available. Utilizing JavaScript, you can also define custom
> tags, although it is more challenging than with filters.


In addition to filters, the Modulo templating language also support powerful
"template tags", which allow for more complicated custom behavior.  This
includes the next two topics in this tutorial: "if" template-tag, which allows
for conditional rendering (e.g.  "only show the submit button if a form is
filled correctly"), and the "for" template-tag, which allows for HTML to be
repeated for each item of some given data (e.g. "every blog post get's it's own
`<li>` element").


## Syntax

Unlike template variables or filters, they use `{%` and `%}` (instead of `{{`
and `}}`) to designate where they are in the _Template_ code.

Template tags are in the format of `{% tag %}`.
They allow for more complicated transformations to the HTML code generated.
For example, here are a few:

    {% include other_template %}

    {% comment %}
        ...
    {% endcomment %}

    {% if state.expanded %}
        ...
    {% endif %}


## The if-tag

One of the most useful template tags you will use is the if tag, written like
this: `{% if %}`.  The if-tag allows for conditional rendering of HTML code
based on the condition supplied.

See below for two examples of using the "if" tag:

    <h1>{{ props.title }}</h1>
    {% if state.expanded %}
        <div><p>Details: {{ props.details }}</p></div>
    {% endif %}
    <hr />
    {% if props.link %}
        <a href="{{ props.link }}">Read more...</a>
    {% else %}
        <em>(No link provided)</em>
    {% endif %}


Note that there are two other tags in the mix. These a related to the `if` tag,
and will only show up after the `if` tag. The first is the `{% endif %}` tag.
This is required, since it shows Modulo what you want the `if` tag to
conditionally include. The second is the `{% else %}` tag. This is optional:
You don't need it for all uses of the `if` tag.

##### Try It Now

1. Examine the code below. Do you see how the `show` checkbox toggles the State
value, which in turn toggles the visibility of the second `div`?

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <div>
        <label>
            <input [state.bind] name="show" type="checkbox" />
            Show details
        </label>
    </div>
    {% if state.show %}
        <div>Look, more stuff here!</div>
    {% endif %}
</Template>
<State
    show:=false
></State>
<Style>
    div {
        border: 1px black solid;
        padding: 3px;
        margin: 3px;
    }
</Style>
```


2. Examine the code below. Do you understand how the `if` template-tag checks
the value of `state.word`  to see if it is filled in, and only shows it back to
the user when the user has started typing?

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <div>
        <label>Enter a word to see it reversed:
            <input [state.bind] name="word"  /></label>
        {% if state.word %}
            <div><p>Reversed: <tt>{{ state.word|reversed }}</tt></div>
        {% else %}
            <p><em>Nothing entered!</em></p>
        {% endif %}
    </div>
</Template>
<State
    word=""
></State>
```

3. **Local file challenge:** Try writing your own if-statements based on other
state variables of your creations.




---------------------------

## Conditional operators

Let's finish off this part of the tutorial with a quick tour of the assortment of conditional 
"if operators". Conditional operators let us check for more complicated conditions in if statements.
There are many operators available, but we'll go over just a few popular ones: `is` (check for equality),
`in` (check for , `gt` (greater than) and `lt` (less than).


### Operators for strings

#### Equality: is


```modulo_demo
<Template>
  <h3>Super secret stuff</h3>
  <input
    placeholder="enter password"
    [state.bind]
    name="password"
  />
  {% if state.password is "hunter2" %}
    <h1>ur in, t1me for hax0ring</h1>
    <p><a href="#">SECRET LINK</a></p>
  {% endif %}
</Template>
<State
   password=""
></State>
```


Just for clarity, this is a coding example, but **this is not a secure password system**.
Anyone can learn Modulo and JavaScript and "hack it" by using the same skills you are learning now. So, don't use
this for something that you want to actually keep a secret!


#### Inclusion: in

```modulo_demo
<Template>
  <textarea [state.bind] name="text"></textarea>
  <p>
    {% if state.secret in state.text %}
    Uh oh, the secret word is in the text!
    {% else %}
    The text is safe: {{ state.text }}
    {% endif %}
  </p>
</Template>
<State
    text="Don't say s3kr1tw0rd"
    secret="s3kr1tw0rd"
></State>
```

Note that the `in` operator can also work on Arrays, Objects, and more. [Read more in the **in, not in operators** section](/docs/templating/tags.html#innotinoperators) in the full docs.

### Operators for numbers

```modulo_demo
<Template>
   <p>A: <input [state.bind] name="a" type="range" min="0" max="20" step="1" /></p>
   <p>B: <input [state.bind] name="b" type="range" min="0" max="20" step="1" /></p>
   <p>{% if state.a is state.b %}A = B (is){% endif %}</p>
   <p>{% if state.a gt state.b %}A > B (gt){% endif %}</p>
   <p>{% if state.a lt state.b %}A < B (lt){% endif %}</p>
</Template>
<State
    a:=10
    b:=0
></State>
```

### Example: Using "gt" with |length filter

Operators can be combined with filters:

```modulo_demo
<Template>
   <h5>Subject length checker</h5>
   <input
      [state.bind]
      name="text"
      style="width: 100%"
   />
   {% if state.text|length gt 20 %}
      <p>Warning, too long! Your subject will look
         truncated: {{ state.text|truncate:20 }}</p>
   {% else %}
      <p>Your subject is short enough. Good job!</p>
   {% endif %}
</Template>
<State
    text="Use no more than 20 characters"
></State>
```


---------------------------

## More useful template features

### Comment tag

Disable broken template code with `{% comment %}` and `{% endcomment %}`, or a
single line comment with `{#` and `#}`:

```
{% comment %}
{% if state.num gt 20 %}
    <p>Your subject is short enough. Good job!</p>
{% endif %}
{% endcomment %}
{# (and this syntax is good for one line) #}
```

Note that unlike HTML comments, this will disable templating code. HTML
comments will actually _not_ disable templating code, e.g.: `<!-- {{ state.data
}} -->` doesn't actually disable the variable, it just creates an HTML comment
with the content of the text of the variable.


### Safe filter: |safe

You can mark text as `|safe` to let it get interpreted as HTML.


### Toggle filter: |yesno

Sometimes what's even quicker than an if statement is the humble `|yesno`
filter:

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <label>Show:
        <input [state.bind] name="active" type="checkbox" /></label>
    <section style="
            display: {{ state.active|yesno:"block,none" }}
        ">
        <p>Showing!</p>
    </section>
</Template>
<State
    active:=false
></State>
```



-----------------------------


# Part 3: Summary


We learned about Shadow DOM and isolating CSS from children using slots. We
learned about the Template Tag "if" that lets us optionally include code. We
learned the similarly useful Template Filter "|yesno", which lets us quickly
add or remove classes.


#### Key terms

* **slot** - A placeholder for content to be inserted when a component is used.
  Useful for writing components that "wrap around" other content.
* **Style isolation** - The _Style_ CPart has several "strategies" or modes for
  isolating the CSS it contains to prevent it from affecting other  components
  in ways you do not intend
* **Component mode** - A way to set components to render in a certain way,
  automatically setting Style to isolate in a certain way as well
    * **mode="vanish"** - A way to make the component "vanish" after rendering,
      and make the Style use classes instead of prefixes
    * **mode="shadow"** - A browser-enforced way to isolate CSS to a component
      so it can't affect other CSS and other CSS can't affect it
* **Template tag** \- A more advanced type of Template code that lets us repeat
  or optionally include other template code based on State data
    * **if-statement** - template tags for optionally including portions of
      template code


#### Next step


At this point, you've half way through, and have learend enough to make some
