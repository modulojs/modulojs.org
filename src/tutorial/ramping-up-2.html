tutorial: Part 2
---


In Part 2 of this tutorial, we'll explore three more features: the State CPart,
Binding State Data, and finally Template Filters.


# State

So far, our components have been static and unchanging. They can't do a lot.
They might be useful for refactoring HTML into more D.R.Y., reusable components,
but not much more than that. They can't validate form data, use APIs, or form
complete applications. In fact, they can't have any sort of _interaction_
whatsoever, or any _dynamic_ or changing content.

## Examining a game's usage of State

Let's put on our "Holmes-style" detective hats and get out our detective
magnifying glasses, we're about to go sleuthing! Examine the usage of this
`<x-MemoryGame>` component, written with Modulo as well and demoed on the
homepage:

```modulo_demo
<Template>

    <h3>Memory game time!</h3>

    <hr />
    <x-MemoryGame></x-MemoryGame>
    <hr />

</Template>
```


This demo component is doing much more than what we have covered in the
tutorial so far. It is changing, or _mutating_ based on user interaction.  This
is no longer a simple, static component, but a _dynamic_ component.

We can deduce two things about this memory game component. Deduction
One: It used a _State_ CPart. We know that it used a _State_ CPart because it
changes or mutates. Without a _State_ CPart, a component cannot "change state",
or mutate or have dynamic content, and instead will be rendered the same way
every time (that is, assuming it has the same _Props_). In other words, if a
component needs to have dynamic content or change over time, then a _State_
CPart is necessary to store this dynamic content.

Now on to Deduction Two: It used a _Script_ CPart. Script CParts allow for
complicated interactions and new behavior to be developed. Unfortunately,
anything as complicated as this game logic requires a background in JavaScript
to accomplish, meaning we will not cover the behavior in this tutorial.
However, if you are familiar with JavaScript, feel free to examine the [demo
source code on the examples page](/examples/) to see how it works yourself!


## Examining a private counter's usage of State

State allows each component instance to store data. Each component instance has
a separate state from every other instance. Instead of using the complex
`x-MemoryGame` example from before, examine the behavior of the following
`x-HelloCount` counting buttons, which increment whenever clicked:



```modulo_demo
<Template>

    <h3>Counting time!</h3>

    <hr />
    <x-HelloCount></x-HelloCount>
    <hr />
    <x-HelloCount></x-HelloCount>
    <hr />
    <x-HelloCount></x-HelloCount>
    <hr />

</Template>
```


Once again, we can determine that state is being used, as the text on the
button changes when that button is clicked. Furthermore, this demonstrates how
state is not shared: Each button is a totally separate instance that keeps
track of it's own separate number.

So far, in our sleuthing, we've accumulated three "CPart facts": Two "_State_
facts" and one "_Script_ fact":

1. **_State Fact:_ Used to make components change** - A *State* CPart is needed if
our component is mutable, or has dynamic, changing data or behavior
2. **_State Fact:_ Private** - Each *State* is private to each component instance
(that is, they keep individual and separate copies of their state data)
3. **_Script Fact:_ Used for complex behavior** - A *Script* CPart is needed to add complex
custom behavior (that is, behavior beyond the core Modulo behavior coded in
custom JavaScript, and also beyond the scope of this *Ramping Up* tutorial)


Let's "peel back the layers" and examine out how these "stateful" or dynamic
components were written.


## State Variables

> **What are variables?** If you are new to coding, you can think of the
> concept of *variables* as being like "buckets for data", or "blanks that can
> be filled in". They allow us to "give a name" to refer to data, allowing for
> more generic code and templates to be written. That is, the same code can
> have different results if the variables change.

Before we can modify data or content, we must first learn how to first
create *State* and *State variables*, which is what we'll learn now.
To add one or more *State variables* to our component, we must define a
_State_ CPart. _State_ CParts are defined much like _Props_, except that
instead of just listing the attribute names, initial values must be provided as
defaults. A _State_ CPart might look like this:

    <State
        count="1"
        color="blue"
    ></State>

Here we are defining two _state variables_: `count`, which we initialize to
equal `"1"`, and `color`, which we initialize to equal `blue`. We can then use
the state variables in our _Template_, in a similar way to how we did with
_Props_:

    <Template>
        <p style="color: {{ state.color }}">
            You have {{ state.count }} bananas.
        </p>
    </Template>

##### Try it now

1.  Practice modifying the **State** CPart (`<State>`) below and re-running to
see how that affects the output.

2.  Practice incorporating these CParts into your own components on a real page
by copying the code here and pasting it within your component definition (that
is, the one that you created in the _Part 1_ of this tutorial)


```modulo_demo
<State
    name="Nonsense"
    verb="toot"
    noun="kazoo"
    count="one hundred"
    animal="duck"
></State>

<Template>
<p>A Very Silly Story:</p><pre>
Professor {{ state.name }}
who had over
{{ state.count }} degrees in
{{ state.noun }}-{{ state.verb }}ing from
{{ state.name }} University,
travelled to
{{ state.name }} City,
a magical land
filled with talking
{{ state.animal }}s, in order
to teach {{ state.count }}
{{ state.animal }}s how
to {{ state.verb }} a {{ state.noun }}.
</pre>
</Template>

# State Binding

So far, we can manually change state in the source code, but our app is still
not interactive, since the actual users (that is, non-coders) cannot change the
state.  This is where "binding" comes into play, where user input is "bound" to
state, such that users of your app  can also modify state variables while using
your app.

To "bind", we'll need to use a _directive_. A _directive_ is a type of HTML
attribute. You can recognize _directive_ by spotting certain special characters
in the attribute name. For example, `<input [state.bind] />` is an `input` HTML
tag with a `[state.bind]` directive. Directives are useful for a variety of
tasks, ranging connecting CParts to each other, to more complicated
modifications to DOM elements. For now, we'll only care about one important
directive: _state.bind_.

## The [state.bind] directive

> **State and predictability** The purpose of _State_ is to separate out
> everything that changes about a component into it's own isolated data
> structure. It should be the case that for a well-written component, if
> anything changes visually, that "visual" change should always start with
> changing state. There should never be a "mismatch", or a way for visual
> changes to occur without state changes. If such a thing were possible, it
> would imply a component that is non-deterministic, or renders unpredictably.
> In other words, given a particular state (and props), a component should be
> predictable or deterministic in that it renders the same way every time.

State comes with a directive that helps "bind" it to form data. What does this
mean? You can attach a `[state.bind]` directive to any `<input>`, and the
_State_ CPart will "sync up" the input with the state after every keystroke.
The binding is "two-way", or it goes in both directions: The input gets the
initial state value, and if the state ever changes, the input will be updated
to reflect that, and if the input ever changes, the state gets updated.

It's best practice to bind all of your form inputs that are in components to
state variables. This is because in order to get the benefits of separating out
state, _all_ visual changes, including something as simple as typing a single
character in an input, should be reflected in state changes.

To bind an input to state, use something like the following:


    <Template>
        <input [state.bind] name="subject" />
    </Template>
    <State
        subject="Testing message..."
    ></State>


##### Try it now

1.  Try modifying the "subject" input box in the preview below. Do you see how
it "quickly reacts" or re-renders the subject text as you type? This is the
power of "binding" inputs to state.

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <p>SUBJECT: {{ state.subject }}</p>
    <input [state.bind] name="subject" />
</Template>
<State
    subject="Testing message..."
></State>
```

-----


## Multiple binds


State allows for multiple inputs to be bound in the same form.  It's important
that you always include a "name" attribute when binding. This should contain
the name of the _State_ variable to be kept in sync with that input.

State also allows binding of different inputs for different data types. For
example, you can use `type="color"` for a color picker, or `type="range"` for a
range slider. For the full range of input types, consider [MDN's "The HTML5
input types" Guide in their *Learn Web Development*
series](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types)


    <Template>
        <input [state.bind] name="subject" />
        <textarea [state.bind] name="body"></textarea>
        <input [state.bind] name="accent" type="color" />
    </Template>
    <State
        subject="Testing message..."
        body="Welcome to my blog"
        accent="#ff3300"
    ></State>


##### Try it now

1.  Examine the below code. See how it uses different types for different
inputs for a "reactive" font selector / customizer?

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <input [state.bind] name="text" />
    <input [state.bind] name="color" type="color" />
    <input [state.bind] name="size"
            type="range" min="12" max="28" step="2" />
    <hr />
    <h5 style="
            font-size: {{ state.size }}px;
            color: {{ state.color }};
        ">
        {{ state.text }}
    </h5>
</Template>
<State
    size="24"
    color="#333030"
    text="Format This Message!"
></State>
```


2.  Now, examine the demo below. This demo takes the lessons learned in the
previous two demos and combines them into a silly story generator. Do you see
how the 5 different form fields are each bound to state, so that when they are
changed, it "reacts" and re-renders the story at once?


```modulo_demo
<Template>
<label>Name: <input [state.bind] name="name" /></label>
<label>Verb: <input [state.bind] name="verb" /></label>
<label>Noun: <input [state.bind] name="noun" /></label>
<label>Count: <input [state.bind] name="count" /></label>
<label>Animal: <input [state.bind] name="animal" /></label>
<p>A Very Silly Story:</p><pre>
Professor {{ state.name }}
who had over
{{ state.count }} degrees in
{{ state.noun }}-{{ state.verb }}ing from
{{ state.name }} University,
travelled to
{{ state.name }} City,
a magical land
filled with talking
{{ state.animal }}s, in order
to teach {{ state.count }}
{{ state.animal }}s how
to {{ state.verb }} a {{ state.noun }}.
</pre>
</Template>

<State
    name="Nonsense"
    verb="toot"
    noun="kazoo"
    count="one hundred"
    animal="duck"
></State>

<Style>
    :host {
        font-size: 0.8rem;
    }
    input {
        width: 50%;
        border: none;
    }
    label {
        display: block;
        border: 2px solid gray;
        padding: 2px;
        margin: 2px;
    }
</Style>
```


3. Practice modifying the demo to add a new variables and input.

4. Extra: Rewrite the demo to feature a silly story of your own!


##### Comprehension Questions


*Background:* Earlier jQuery-style JS frameworks were more concerned with
manipulating the DOM directly. Now, the modern approach is to combine
templating and/or DOM building tools (e.g. JSX, virtual DOM) with "state
management" (e.g. Redux, useState).  Modulo closely follows this modern
approach, where the "moving parts" of the application are put into state, and
then by changing state, the component re-displays itself, showing the new data.

* **Why have state?** What benefits does it have? Why not just modify DOM
  directly whenever you want to using JavaScript?

* **Why keep State separate for each individual component?** Why is state
  private, instead of shared across all components?

* **Why use State binding?** Why do we "bind" state to inputs? Why not use
  JavaScript to get the value?

*Answer:* This is due to perceived flaws with the original approach of direct
DOM manipulation: Pretty soon as an app grows, you get a big tangled mess of
different code reaching in different spots. Frontend frameworks clearly needed
an "MVC Model"-like structure to "keep stuff separate".

This "detangles" the spaghetti mess of DOM manipulation: Instead of one button
inserting stuff over here, and one input reaching in and sending data over
there, the "state" creates a single "choke-point" that keeps data "flowing" in
one direction. No matter what you want changed, you do one thing: _Change state
and rerender_!

This also allows for quickly developing "reactive" forms. Furthermore, using
Modulo in particular, it allows for declarative programming of reactive forms
without use of JavaScript.

If you are still scratching your head over the use of `[state.bind]` but are
familiar with vanilla JS, it's all about reducing the need to "manually reach"
into the DOM. It simplifies code like this `var inputData =
document.getElementsByName('myinput')[0].value` (or the similar
`$('[name=myinput]').val()` in jQuery), with more readable code like
`state.myinput`, and similarly untangles code for validation, API requests,
etc.

# Template Filters

> **Built-in Filters and Custom Filters** - Modulo comes with many filters
> pre-installed: Read [Templating Reference - Built-In
> Filters](/docs/templating/filters.html) for examples of all
> filters available. Utilizing JavaScript, you can also define custom filters.
> Read [Templating - Filters](/docs/templating/index.html#filters) for more
> information.

The Modulo templating language has two core features: _filters_ (for formatting
values), and _template-tags_ (for control-flow). We will learn the first of
these now.

## Template Filters

Template _filters_ "format" or otherwise transform template variables. The
template filter syntax consists of taking a template variable and adding a
vertical bar followed the name of a filter (e.g. `varName|filterName`). The
following example will transform the text contained in the `props.name`
template variable to make it all uppercase:

    Hello {{ props.name|upper }}

Some filters can also take extra modifiers or options. This is called the
template filter _argument_. Do you recall how our previous `x-ExampleBtn`
component only supported either "round" or "square" as CSS classes? In this
next snippet, see how the `|allow` template filter ensures that only "round" or
"square" are permitted:


    <button class="my-btn my-btn__{{ props.shape|allow:"round,square" }}">
        (... snip ...)
    </button>


Note how the argument is separated from the filter with a colon: The general
syntax is `varName|filterName:"argument"`. Thus, the `|allow:"round,square"`
filter instructs Modulo to _only_ output the property of `props.shape` if it
exactly matches the text "round" or "square".


##### Try It Now

```modulo_demo
<Template>

<div>
    <label>Username:
        <input [state.bind] name="username" /></label>
    <label>Color ("green" or "blue"):
        <input [state.bind] name="color" /></label>
    <label>Opacity: <input [state.bind]
        name="opacity"
        type="number" min="0" max="1" step="0.1" /></label>

    <h5 style="
            opacity: {{ state.opacity }};
            color: {{ state.color|allow:'green,blue'|default:'red' }};
        ">
        {{ state.username|lower }}
    </h5>
</div>

</Template>

<State
    opacity="0.5"
    color="blue"
    username="Testing_Username"
></State>
```

1.  Try modifying the "Username" input box in the preview above. Do you see how
it "quickly reacts" or re-renders the username text in lower-case as you type?
2.  Try also adjusting the "Opacity" input to see how it updates the
transparency of the text, and the "Color" input, which only supports "blue" or
"green" (anything else turns red).
3.  Examine the code in the _Template_ CPart. Examine each input, and how it
uses the `[state.bind]` directive to keep it in-sync with state. The
`name="username"`, `name="color"`, and `name="opacity"` attributes are what the
State CPart uses to figure out which state variable should be "linked".
4.  Now, practice the link in "the other way": That is, see how _State_
populates the inputs' values. You can do this by changing the initial values of
_State_ and then re-running the program. See how by changing the initial values
of _State_ it will also update the initial values of the linked inputs?



Clarification: The other attributes, (e.g. `name`, along with `type`, `max`,
`min`, and `step`), are _not_ Modulo directives, but are instead plain HTML
attributes. The State CPart reuses `name`, but will ignore the others.

**Further practice:** Practice incorporating these CParts into your own
components on a real page by copying the code here and pasting it within your
component definition (that is, the one that you created in the _Part 1_ of this
tutorial)

### Part 2: Summary

In this section, we learned how to know when to use Modulo's State feature
(when there is changing data or appearances), and how to use it. We learned how
to use `[state.bind]` directive to an input.  We learned how to use Modulo's
templating language to include variables and format values using filters.

##### Key terms

* **State** \- A CPart used to include changing data, which is used to render
  the HTML of the component
* **Directive** \- A special type of HTML attribute that "hooks in"
  functionality to otherwise plain HTML elements. One built-in directive
  includes:
    * `[state.bind]` \- two-way binds inputs to state variables, so modifying
      the input modifies the variable, and vice-versa
* **Template variable** and **template filter** \- Modulo's Templating language
  can include template variables (e.g. `{{ props.name }}`) mixed in with the
  HTML, and possibly modified or reformatted by attaching template filters
  (e.g. `{{ props.name|upper }}`)

#### Next step

At this point, you've learned enough to be dangerous! In the next step, you'll
learn more advanced features: How to add static or API data, how to assemble
more complicated data as "data props", and finally a tiny peak into scripting,
for those curious about JavaScript.
