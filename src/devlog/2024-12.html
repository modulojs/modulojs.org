title: Holiday Release
devlog: 2024-12
---


Happy Holidays, all! I added the finishing touches and pushed out the newest
batch of improvements, fixes, and new features.
This release marks the first that starts the process toward a more stable `0.1.0` or
"beta" release (likely around the `~0.0.75` or `~0.0.80` releases).  More info
on the release plans contained below. Here's to a fantastic 2025!


## Alpha 73



### Alpha 73 New Feature

The big new feature is the _Include_ definition. This definition is very
verstatile, and can be used for including virtually any type of head content,
including `<script>` tags for raw inclusion of JS, and `<link>` for CSS.

Not only that, but it supports a "NPM-light" sort of usage as well, that allows
you to quickly include JS and CSS, instantly accessing many NPM packages.


### Alpha 73 Deprecations

This is one of the first releases with deprecations. The following features
will be removed in future versions:

- `mode="vanish-into-document"` - Use `mode="vanish"` and _Include_ instead (see below)
- `mountRender` Lifecycle - Use `mount` instead

Furthermore, take note about the following changes which will be gradually
implemented in this and future versions:

- Directives: The `[` and `]` is becoming optional, e.g. `state.bind` and
  `on.click:=script.count` will now be preferred
- Artifacts will be changing to _only_ bundle from _Include_ by default,
  leaving other JS and CSS untouched
- Default dehydrate/hydrate behavior will no longer hydrate directives in DOM, but
  instead always attempt to rerender to re-attach directives


### Alpha 73 Bug Fixes

Browser support got a big boost: Rewriting some incompatible regex has now
enabled Safari 11 support, improving Modulo's shim-free support for unsupported
legacy Apple devices from 2014-2018.



## Getting started with Alpha 73's include

### Example 1: For script and link dependencies

The simplest way to use `Include` is as a global definition. It will "include"
it's contents in the head of the document  as soon as Modulo loads. Note that
it will NEVER include the same thing twice (it uses hashes to identify
resources).  This mode is great for following tutorials for integrating JS
projects. 

For example, to include Quill JS, it's as easy as just pasting in the head
content they give you:

```
<Include>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quill@2.0.3/dist/quill.snow.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quill@2.0.3/dist/quill.js">/script>
</Include>
```



### Example 2: Including meta content

_Include_ can be used for adding meta tags to your page as well:

```
<Include>
    <meta name="description" content="A great Modulo website" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="charset" charset="utf8" />
</Include>
```

### Additional features

Also, note that you can use `-load-mode="lazy"` to make it skip the bundle, and
only get inserted as-is on page load. This is great for fixing bugs with
integrating other JS packages, while supporting advanced features like
JavaScript modules and `import` statements.


### Alpha 73 Deprecation FAQ


- Q: Why is `vanish-into-document` is being removed? A: We already have `vanish`, and
  now we also have `Include`, making `vanish-into-document` obsolute as a
  component render mode.

- Q: Why the directive syntax change? A: While browsers technically allow those
  characters, this makes the directive attribute naming convention follow the
  W3C HTML spec more strictly, which, in practice, enables better
  compatibility. Otherwise, third-party JS libraries crash when using the
  stricter `setAttribute` interface on HTML generated from Modulo.

- Q: Why are directives no longer going to be dehydrated? A: Note that  this
  change will result in slightly less efficient hydration steps in some cases.
  However, the trade-off is simpler and faster builds, more consistent behavior
  between development and production, and preventing easy "foot guns" that
  result in excess re-render during hydration loops. That said, the old
  behavior will still be available as a recipe for an alternative build
  command, as it might be a nice tweak to further optimize specific SSG
  projects.





## Beta Road Map: On the road to stability!

This release represents one of the last big feature additions until the Modulo
beta, `Modulo.js v0.1.0`! Going forward, the focus will be fully documenting
the _build_ and _Include_ architecture, for fine-tuning of large, multi-page
websites that use Modulo. Furthermore, the Component Part extension interface
will get fully documented.

I expect this release, and the next few releases, to be among the last alpha
releases. The remaining alphas will continue to support the deprecated
features, but as soon as the new replacements are finished and documented, the
deprecated features will be removed in the first beta release.

This means I am trying my best to avoid having to add or remove any major
features from "beta" to "1.0".  The goal of the subseuqent beta releases (e.g.,
`0.2.x`, `0.3.x`), in preparation for a highly-stable, semi-final 1.0 release,
are to polish, stabilize, and provide crystal-clear documentation and
best-practices.
