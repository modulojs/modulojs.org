I'm happy to announce the release of Alpha 0.0.74, which documents and fixes some 
much needed tweaks to Alpha 73, while still keeping it all under 2000 lines of code.
These are essential to continue to move to _Include_-focused architecture.


## Alpha 74


### Alpha 74 New Feature

The big new feature from the last release is the _Include_ definition.

Previously, we only focused on it being used to include LINK

Not only that, but it supports a "NPM-light" sort of usage as well, that allows
you to quickly include JS and CSS, instantly accessing many NPM packages.

### New behavior: Blocking by default.

New behavior: _Includes_ are now blocking by default. To disable this behavior, use `async`.

By default, _Include_ blocks loading. This means that _Configuration_ scripts can freely reference
things loaded. This can be disabled with the `-async:=true` setting. See below:

```
<Include -async:=true>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quill@2.0.3/dist/quill.js">/script>
</Include>
<script Configuration>
    console.log(window.Quill) // will be undefined    
/script>
```

However, without `-async`, the _Include_ becomes blocking. So, the following would work as intended:

```
<Include> <!-- defaults to -async:=false -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quill@2.0.3/dist/quill.js">/script>
</Include>
<script Configuration>
    // Modulo will pause everything until the quill script's onload event fires
    console.log(window.Quill) // Will be defined, since the script is loaded
/script>
```



### New settings: `-load-mode` and Component includes

### Example 1: Un-bundled include

By default, `-load-mode="bundled"`. However, you can set it to `-load-mode="lazy"` to make it only
load later.

```
<Include -load-mode="lazy">
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quill@2.0.3/dist/quill.snow.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quill@2.0.3/dist/quill.js">/script>
</Include>
<script Configuration>
    console.log(window.Quill) // Will be defined, but when built, will not be in bundle (will be separate tag)
/script>
```


### Example 2: Component includes

Includes can now be embedded in `<Component>` as well:

```
<Component>
    <Include -load-mode="lazy">
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quill@2.0.3/dist/quill.snow.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quill@2.0.3/dist/quill.js">/script>
    </Include>
</Component>
```

This is super useful when combined with load-modes, since then you can have certain JavaScript or CSS only
load when a component first appears.

### New settings: `-server` for package management


Use `-server="..."` - use for packages from NPM. Thus, _Include_ can be used kind of like
a simple `package.json`-type version locking system. See the following:

```
<Include
    -server="unpkg.com"
    my-package="3.2.5"
    my-other-package="5.2.3"
></Include>
```




## Modulo Beta Teaser - Coming soon!

These last releases represent some of the last big feature additions until the Modulo
beta, `Modulo.js v0.1.0`!  In the mean time, check out the following early work in
progress "teasers" of what's in store:

### Coming soon: Modulo Studio

The embedded, mini-editor is getting a major remix with the Modulo JS Beta
release.  This enables all Modulo users to take advantage of it's
ultra-minimalist structure, as an easy-to-use "glue" to combine editors,
previewers and in-browser emulators, and more. This creates an ultra-simple set
of building-blocks for IDEs, embedded editors, and even graphical WYZIWIG
editors.

For example, a simple website editor IDE might be assembled as such:

```
<Component name="WebEditor">
  <!-- Include some core editor HTML and CSS -->
  <Template -src="./parts/EditorBase.html"></Template>
  <Style -src="./parts/EditorBase.css"></Style>

  <!-- Include the Virtual Browser part, which enables a preview -->
  <VBrowser></VBrowser>

  <!-- Load a sample website into the virtual browser -->
  <Template
      -file="index.html"
      -name="index_template"
      -default-view
      -default-edit>
        <h1>Hello web world!</h1>
        <p>Edit me...</p>
  </Template>

  <!-- Define menus, buttons, etc -->
  <Template
      -button="run"
      -button-emoji="&#x27F3;"
      -button-click="vbrowser.refresh"
      -name="run_button_template"
  ><!-- (a "re-run" button) --></Template>
</Component>
```

### Coming soon: New, clean Modulo repo

The Modulo [beta branch](https://codeberg.org/modulo/modulo) is being developed
on Codeberg.  Once complete, this minimalist repo structure will become the
main repo, and the GitHub repo will be deprecated.



### Coming soon: Modulo in the Wild

The Modulo JS framework, despite still being only "alpha", has now been used to
power everything from tiny app projects to building out multi-media experiences
with thousands of users a day. It's time we start showcasing what the (tiny)
Modulo community has been up to! There are _dozens_ of us! _Dozens!_
