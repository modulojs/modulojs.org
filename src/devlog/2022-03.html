title: Alpha
devlog: 2022-03
---


After years of development as a side-project, Modulo is close to an "alpha" release. The plan for the alpha release is to get early feedback before we finalize the external API, or spend time optimizing for DOM performance or readability of source-code.

### After alpha?

Once the API is more or less finalized, and the library itself has enjoyed some limited ("dogfooding") production usage, then it's time for the "beta" release. Finally, as it gets more production usage, it's time for the `v1.0` release, which is intended to be a highly stable release for the future, with few, if any new features.

### Known bugs

**Directives nested in child components are broken**: Directive resolution context for child components with non-shadow slots still has issues, resolving to the immediate parent (the child component) instead of the more expected parent (the parent doing the nesting).

**m.bundle**: Incomplete

### Major incomplete aspects of API

Library / Load / Loader / Module / Config / Modulo configuration refactor: Currently, a variety of CParts do similar tasks. We want to condense them all into a new "Library" CPart, and abandon "Module" terminology, since it can easily be confused with the unrelated concept of JavaScript modules.

## Project Status

**Current status:** `prealpha`

_Prealpha means... shhhhh! This site is not yet ready to be released._

## Roadmap:

`alpha`

**Completed:** core functionality, under 2000 SLOC, ssg to generate website via JSDOM, partial documentation, unit tests for examples, directives, new DOM resolver, Script-tag insertion,Browser builds, CSS bundling, basic SSG for site, tutorial part 3, documentation (CParts and core API)

**Incomplete:** "Modulo" object instantiation and config system, module / Library refactor and documentation, reconciliation directives refactor, some light performance profiling & improvement

  

`beta`

**Incomplete:** Nested namespaces, hot-reloading server, under 1000 SLOC (?), fully literate source code, MDU development and documentation, SSG refactor, full interactive "cookbook" of recipes, React & jQuery examples, deterministic SSG builds, more performance profiling & improvement

  

`v1.0`

**Incomplete:** Fully stabilized API, Full browser testing matrix, generate .map files, several recommended minified and shimmed versions, example rollup and webpack configs, split-off SSG and MDU
