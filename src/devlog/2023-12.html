I'm happy to announce the release of Alpha 0.0.71, which brings quite a bit of
code quality improvements, several bug fixes, more tests, and a few new really
handy features, while still keeping it all under 2000 lines of code.


## Alpha 71 - Builds and CSS improvements

## New features

The new features I'll outline below -- further documentation to follow:

- Style: Relative `url()` replacement, bug fixes. Style is now capable of
  replacing relative `url()` that it encounters, allowing for easy bundling of
  CSS sheets that have `background: url(./myimage.png)` style syntax. It can
  replace them with remote or absolute URLs, and this feature can be disabled
  with `url-replace=:=false`.

- Artifact: Artifact is now flexible and easily configurable for custom builds
    - Simply by registering an Artifact (`<Artifact name="css">`, for example),
      you can begin to customize or add CSS output
    - By adding a `remove=` to your Artifact, you can scrub your HTML before
      saving the built version, e.g. `remove="div.delete-me"` to remove all
      divs with `delete-me` class.
    - By adding a `bundle=` to your Artifact, you can specify which elements
      get bundled, or disable it with `bundle:=false`
    - Now you can register things like JavaScript, CSS, or HTML minifiers as
      Template filters, and then include them into your build configurations
    - Using the Modulo Template syntax allows for extremely precise control
      over the exact JavaScript and CSS output.

- Template: Template can now be instantiated easily from JavaScript

- Node.js compatibility: The Modulo.js file can now be imported, and some
  features (e.g. Template) used within the Node.js environment

- Namespace aliases: A handy feature allowing "nicknames" to be used for
  namespaces. This is useful both for situations where private components that
  could potentially have conflicting names (e.g. if two libraries both want to
  use x-Button). This allows component library authors to export their
  libraries, while aliasing their namespace locally.

## Code quality improvements

The code quality improvements will bring the quality of the project closer to
the point where I can finally release the first beta (version 0.1.0). This is
when I am confident that the Component Part and definition API won't change too
much, and people can start extending Modulo as they see fit without fear of
their plug-ins or extension breaking with the release of a future version.

In particular, I refactored the _Template_ class, which will now begin to
receive documentation, so you can use the Modulo templates outside of a Modulo
project, or in a node.js application, or what have you. Furthermore, I
refactored the command build system, and the _Artifact_ system, so you will be
able to begin to fully customize builds. This enables Modulo to support things
like split builds, plug-in minifiers, and even pre-built media artifacts.

```javascript
// Now, Template has a JavaScript-friendly interface as well:
const { modulo } = require('mdu.js');
const { Template } = modulo.registry.cparts;
let myTemplate = new Template('Hello {{ example-var }} world!');
let results = myTemplate.render({ exampleVar: 'node.js' });
console.log('The results:', results);
```


## Slot behavior consistency

A great deal of effort was put into improving consistency of behavior of slots
between shadow components and regular components, and reducing the number of
patches needed or unnecessary renders when you are refreshing with slots. This
required refactoring _Reconciler_ and _DOMCursor_. Hopefully, this will end a
lot of the bugginess around mismatching elements when copying slots in regular
or vanish modes, and any issues of nested components with nested slots
mismatching their directive resolution.
