I'm happy to announce the release of Alpha 0.0.66, which brings quite a bit of
code quality improvements, several bug fixes, more tests, and a few new really
handy features, while still keeping it all under 2000 lines of code.


## Alpha 66 - Builds and CSS improvements

## Code quality improvements

The code quality improvements will bring the quality of the project closer to
the point where I can finally release the first beta (version 0.1.0). This is
when I am confident that the Component Part and definition API won't change too
much, and people can start extending Modulo as they see fit without fear of
their plug-ins or extension breaking with the release of a future version.

In particular, I refactored the _Template_ class, which will now begin to
receive documentation, so you can use the Modulo templates outside of a Modulo
project, or in a node.js application, or what have you. Furthermore, I
refactored the command build system, and the _Artifact_ system, so you will be
able to begin to fully customize builds. This enables Modulo to support things
like split builds, plug-in minifiers, and even pre-built media artifacts.

```javascript
# Now, Template has a JavaScript-friendly interface as well
const { Template } = modulo.registry.cparts;
let myTemplate = new Template('Hello {{ example-var }} world!');
let results = myTemplate.render({ exampleVar: 'node.js' });
console.log('The results:', results);
```

## New features

The new features I'll outline below -- further documentation to follow:

- Style: Relative `url()` replacement, bug fixes. Style is now capable of
  replacing relative `url()` that it encounters, allowing for easy bundling of
  CSS sheets that have `background: url(./myimage.png)` style syntax. It can
  replace them with remote or absolute URLs, and this feature can be disabled
  with `url-replace=:=false`.

- Artifact: Artifact is now flexible and easily configurable for custom builds
    - Simply by registering an Artifact (`<Artifact name="css">`, for example),
      you can begin to customize or add CSS output
    - By adding a `remove=` to your Artifact, you can scrub your HTML before
      saving the built version, e.g. `remove="div.delete-me"` to remove all
      divs with `delete-me` class.
    - By adding a `bundle=` to your Artifact, you can specify which elements
      get bundled, or disable it with `bundle:=false`
    - Now you can register things like JavaScript, CSS, or HTML minifiers as
      Template filters, and then include them into your build configurations
    - Using the Modulo Template syntax allows for extremely precise control
      over the exact JavaScript and CSS output.

- Template: Template can now be instantiated easily from JavaScript

- Node.js compatibility: The Modulo.js file can now be imported
