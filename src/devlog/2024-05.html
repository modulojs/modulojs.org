title: 14 new tutorials
devlog: 2024-05

Welcome to a Summer of Modulo improvements! Huge updates are just around the
corner, bringing new definitions, new features, and even a few deprecations.
All of these features are intended to bring Modulo closer to it's first 
release no-longer labeled "alpha": Version `0.1.0`.


However, you'll have to wait for those features, since I haven't released a new
version of Modulo just yet. These last few months I have instead written loads
of new, mini-tutorials. Each tutorial teaches how to make a different type of
component, or use a different feature


## Byte-sized tutorials

Tutorials range between 3 minutes and 10 minutes, but all provide an easy
component to copy and paste in the end. Ultimately, the goal is not only to
give you a component, but to  teach you the underlying reasoning behind
building each feature.


## Fun

While I try to keep things a little "fun", the rest of the documentation is
pretty dang serious. documentation. However, for these tutorials, I wanted
something more accessible, interesting, and hopefully not-too-bording. Each
tutorial is pretty "flashy": This makes them ideal for learning, even if 

Most of the tutorials are very visual and focus on learning design techniques,
or how to build design tools. Some even integrate fun APIs, like a Pokemon API.

## Get learning!
