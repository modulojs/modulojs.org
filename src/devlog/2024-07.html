title: Holiday Release
devlog: 2024-12

I'm happy to announce the release of Alpha 0.0.73, which brings quite a few new
handy features, while still keeping it all under 2000 lines of code. It also
introduces the first deprecation notice: `vanish-into-document` is being
removed.  Why? We already have `vanish`, and now we also have `Include`, making
`vanish-into-document` obsolute as a component render mode.


## Alpha 73

### New feature: Include Component Part and Core Definition

The big new feature is the _Include_ definition. This definition is very
verstatile, and can be used for including virtually any type of head content,
including `<script>` tags for raw inclusion of JS, and `<link>` for CSS.

Not only that, but it supports a "NPM-light" sort of usage as well, that allows
you to quickly include JS and CSS, instantly accessing many NPM packages.

### Example 1: For dependencies

One of the most powerful features of _Include_ is the ability to bring in
packages from NPM (or equivalent), given their package name and a CDN server.
See below:

```
<Include
    -server="unpkg.com"
    cke="1.3.4"
></Include>
```



### Example 2: Including raw content

The simplest way to use `Include` is as a global definition. It will "include"
it's contents in the head of the document  as soon as Modulo loads. Note that
it will NEVER include the same thing twice (it uses hashes to identify
resources).

This mode is great for following tutorials for integrating JS projects. You can
often simply copy and paste whatever you are given into the `Include`, as such:


## On the road to beta?


This release represents one of the last big feature additions until the Modulo
beta, version 0.1.0! Going forward, the focus will be fully documenting the
_build_ and _Include_ architecture, for fine-tuning of large, multi-page
websites that use Modulo.

In the mean time, check out the following sneak peaks of what's in store:

### Coming soon: Modulo in the Wild

The Modulo JS framework, despite still being only "alpha", has now been used to
power everything from tiny app projects to building out multi-media experiences
with thousands of users a day. It's time we start showcasing what the (tiny)
Modulo community has been up to!

### Coming soon: Modulo Studio

The embedded, mini-editor is getting a major facelift, and, more importantly,
being exposed as a general editor framework! Soon,.
