# Props

> **Read-only** Props are read-only within a component, and only be set by the
> parent component. If the values change, the component re-renders with the new
> values. They are only supposed to be information being _passed to_ the
> component, which means they can't be changed internally. For internal,
> mutable data, use [State](#state) instead.

Props allow components to receive data. You can think of Props as being like
"function parameters": They allow you to pass down "arguments" (attributes) to
component which can then modify it's appearance, behavior, or content based on
the values of these parameters.

Props are set by the parent component (or HTML page). For String values, use plain attributes (e.g. `<x-Btn design="round">`). For any non-String types, you can use _data props_ set using a `:=` directive syntax for (e.g. `<x-Chart data:='[1, 2, 3]'>`).

### renderObj

Props contributes it's received values to the renderObj. Examples:

1.  Prop set like: `<x-Btn design="round">` will be accessible on the renderObj
like `renderObj.props.design`, and in the Script or Template CParts like
`props.design`.
2.  Prop set like: `<x-Chart data:='["a", "b"]'>` will be accessible on the
renderObj like `renderObj.props.data` (with individual items accessed with code
that ends with "`.data[0]`"), and in the Script or Template CParts like
`props.data`.
