title: Style - CParts

# Style

The _Style_ CPart allows us to write CSS for our component. This allows us to
group styles within our component, and keep them isolated from other
components, without having to come up with long, confusing class names every
time. CSS written here will be automatically prefixed so that it will only
apply to your component and/or any HTML that it generates, such as by the
_Template_ CPart.

## General usage

In general, you can freely write any number of CSS rules for your components.
They will be prefixed based on a few regular expression replacement steps, such
that they only apply to the elements within your component. For example, a rule
like `a { color: blue }` in a component named `name="HelloBtn"` that has been
imported with `namespace="mylib"` would result in the following, fully-prefixed
rule: `mylib-HelloBtn a { color: blue }`

### Typical usage

```modulo_demo
<Template>
Hello <strong>Modulo</strong> World!
<p class="neat">Any HTML can be here!</p>
</Template>
<Style>
/* ...and any CSS here! */
strong {
    color: blue;
}
.neat {
    font-variant: small-caps;
}
:host { /* styles the entire component */
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: cornsilk;
    padding: 5px;
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 0 turquoise;
}
</Style>
```


## Advanced usage

If you want to go deeper, you might customize it with specifying a
`url-replace` mode, or an `isolation-mode`.

### URL Replacement

By default (`url-replace:=true`), it will attempt to "fix" all relative URLs
into absolute URLs, either with the host specified or without, if (and only if)
you imported that _Style_ with a `-src=` attribute. To turn off this feature,
specify `url-replace:=false` on your _Style_ component.

#### URL replacement example

To see the `url-replace` feature in action, see below:

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    Hello <strong>Modulo</strong> World! <p class="neat">This
    background works even when the CSS is bundled.</p>
</Template>
<!-- In sample.css, we have background: url('./example_image.jpg')
    and its replaced with url('/static/data/eg/example_image.jpg') -->
<Style
    -src="/static/data/eg/sample.css"
></Style>
```

##### Without url-replace

To see why it's necessary, try disabling the `url-replace` feature and note how
the background no longer works (since it will use the relative URL given in the
image, which is then relative to this page, instead of the CSS file):

```modulo
<Style
    url-replace:=false
    -src="/static/data/eg/sample.css"
></Style>
```

### Isolation modes

The Style CPart is capable of "isolating" it's contents using one of several
strategies: Prefix isolation (using the "descendent" CSS selector), Class
isolation (where a class is attached to all matching elements generated by the
Component, and the `:is()` CSS selector is used to join the class with all
selectors in the Component), and finally Shadow

#### Prefix isolation (default for `<Component ...`)

By default, components have "regular" rendering mode. This will cause it to
prefix like described above. That is, every selector in the CSS styles enclosed
will be prefixed with the name of the component.

For example, a rule like `div.alert { color: green }` in a component named
`name="HelloBtn"` that has been imported with `namespace="mylib"` would result
in the following, fully-prefixed rule: `mylib-HelloBtn a { color: blue }`

#### Class isolation (`<Component mode="vanish"...`)

By default, components have "regular" rendering mode. If you've configured your
component to instead use "vanish" rendering or "vanish-into-document", it will
to make the component function as basically a one-time template that "vanishes"
away after rendering, leaving only it's children. When this mode is set, the
Style CPart will enable class-based isolation.

The technique for this is the most involved of the three isolation modes: It
will modify your resulting DOM to add a class, by default generated from the
Component name, to every referenced element. Finally, it will change the style
sheet to only select elements that have this new class.

Example: If there is a style like `p.quote strong`, in a component named
`mylib-HelloBtn`, then it will re-use the component name as a CSS class to the
which it adds to the `strong` element specified. Then it will use the `:is()`
CSS selector is used to join the class, resulting in the CSS of:
`.mylib-HelloBtn:is(p.quote strong)`

#### Shadow DOM isolation (`<Component mode="shadow"...`)

By default, components have "regular" rendering mode. If you've configured your
component to instead use "Shadow DOM" rendering to protect it from getting
outside CSS applied to it, then the _Style_ will be "encapsulated" or inserted
in the "shadow root" of component instances, as opposed to the document root.
(More on this here:
[MDN's "ShadowRoot.styleSheets"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot/styleSheets))

When using Shadow DOM, both the stylesheet and DOM will NOT be modified.
Instead, the CSS will automatically be isolated by nature of the browser's
shadow DOM CSS isolation feature. This isolates the component's DOM from the
parent's styles, causing guaranteed CSS isolation. Keep in mind, however, it
creates a new "open shadow root" DOM node, and prevents global styles (e.g.
regular link tags) from being applied. If you prefer using shadow DOM for
components, you can share base-style across shared Style components (browsers
should notice repeated duplicate shadow DOM sheet insertions and should be
optimized accordingly).

`div.alert { color: green }` in a component named `name="HelloBtn"` that has
been imported with `namespace="mylib"` would result in the following,
fully-prefixed rule: `mylib-HelloBtn a { color: blue }`

`isolate-class` \- Force "isolate class" feature to be on, even if the
component is not in a vanish-based rendering mode. component itself. This will
work for both "regular" and "shadow" rendering mode. For example, in regular
rendering mode, if you have the CSS `:host { color: red }` in a component named
`name="MyChart"` that has been imported with `namespace="mylib"`, then it would
create the following, fully-prefixed CSS rule: `mylib-MyChart { color: red }`
`:host` \- Use the ":host" pseudo-element to select the component itself. This
will work for both "regular" and "shadow" rendering mode. For example, in
regular rendering mode, if you have the CSS `:host { color: red }` in a
component named `name="MyChart"` that has been imported with
`namespace="mylib"`, then it would create the following, fully-prefixed CSS
rule: `mylib-MyChart { color: red }`
