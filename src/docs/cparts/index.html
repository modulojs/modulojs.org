# CParts

The central concept to Modulo Components is that of _Component Parts_. In this
documentation and code it will be often shortened to _CParts_. Every component
definition consists of configuring one or more CPart definitions. Modulo comes
"batteries-included" with about 6 CParts, which provide the core functionality
of building Modulo Components, and are documented here.

Conventionally, when defining components, CParts are listed in the following
order within a given _Component_ definition:

1.  [Props](props.html)
2.  [Template](template.html)
3.  _(Any other CParts)_
4.  [State](state.html)
5.  [StaticData](staticdata.html)
6.  [Script](script.html)
7.  [Style](style.html)

The rationale for this ordering is to put _Props_ and _Template_ first since
they are often the first CParts that are important to read when trying to
understand or debug the behavior of a _Component_, while putting _Style_ last
as it's typically the least important to read. Note that ordering makes a
difference: They will be processed in the order given.

Typically, you will not need to have more than one of the same type of CPart in
a given component. However, in some cases for particular CParts it might make
sense, such as to mix in multiple _Styles_ into a single _Component_. In the
case of duplicate CParts of the same type, often the behavior is that "whoever
gets the last word in wins", or the configuration specified by the final CPart
takes precedence (although this depends on the CPart in question).
