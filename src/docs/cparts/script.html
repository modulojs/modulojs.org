_Script_ CParts allow you to define custom behavior for components using the
full power of JavaScript. The most common use of _Script_ tags is to add more
sophisticated interactive behavior. Instead of just relying on premade CParts,
with a Script tag you can program any custom behavior into your component.

### Definition

_Script_ is traditionally included in _Component_ definitions below the _State_
or _Template_ tag. _Script_ has no expected attributes, but instead only has a
text-content.

#### Typical use

The most common use of a _Script_ CPart is to specify custom JS code that is
either run once after fulling loading all dependencies, or once each time the
component renders. See below for a simple example:


```
<Component name="ButtonExample">
    <Template>...</Template>
    <State>...</State>
    <Script>
        console.log("Will execute once after loading dependencies");
        function initializedCallback() {
            console.log("Executes every time an instance of ButtonExample is created");
        }
        function updateCallback() {
            console.log("Executes after every rerender of the component");
        }
    /Script>
</Component>
```

#### Using within embedded component definitions

Problems arise when attempting to include a _Script_ CPart within an embedded
Component `<script Modulo>` definition, e.g. one that is being defined within
the script tag of the same HTML file that it is being used on. This is because
the `<` `/Script>` tag will end up closing off the outer `<script>` tag early,
due to HTML syntax. The reason is that `</` `script>` is a special syntax that
automatically closes the outer tag, and also HTML cannot distinguish capital
(the `<Script>` CPart) vs lowercase (the outer `<script>` tag). The ideal
solution is to simply move the component to a separate library file, included
with `-src=` syntax, since that is preferred in general, and solves other
issues as well (e.g. templating instructions in HTML tags).  However, if you
simply must include a _Script_ tag in an embedded component definition you can
write `<def Script>` as the opening tag, and `</def>` as the closing tag. See
the following:


```
<script Modulo src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js">
    <Component name="ButtonExample">
        <def Script>
            console.log("Hello, world!");
        </def>
    </Component>
/script>
```

A better alternative is to use the slightly more verbose `<template Modulo>` instead:

```
<template Modulo>
    <Component name="ButtonExample">
        <Script>
            console.log("Hello, world!");
        /Script>
    </Component>
</template>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mdu.js">/script>
```

### Defining event callbacks

The most common purpose of a Script CPart is to add custom behavior when certain "events" occur to your component. Consider the following example of 3 click events:

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <button @click:=script.doConsole>Console Log</button>
    <button @click:=script.doAlert>Show Alert</button>
    <button @click:=script.countUp>Counter {{ state.num }}</button>
</Template>
<State
    num:=42
></State>
<Script>
    function doConsole() {
        console.log("Event callback. State.num is:", state.num);
    }
    function doAlert() {
        alert("Event callback. State.num is: " + state.num);
    }
    function countUp() {
        state.num++;
    }
/Script>
```

In this, the _Script_ CPart defines a function named `countUp`. The `@click:=`
attribute on the button utilizes directives to attach a "click event" to the
button, such that when a user clicks on that button it will invoke the
`countUp` function.

From within event callbacks, the _Script_ CPart exposes the current renderObj as variables. So, `state` by itself is equivalent to `renderObj.state`. This enables us to directly modify the state by simply doing `state.count++`. By default, components rerender after every event, so after the event the component will rerender and visually reflect the state changes.

This means that all renderObj variables will be available here, in a similar way to how _Template_ exposes them: For example, you can use code like `props.XYZ` to access data from a _Props_ CPart.

You can also access the JavaScript Object instances of the CPart Class. To access those, you use the `cparts`

Finally, the variable `element` will refer to the HTML element of the current component. This is useful for direct DOM manipulation or interfacing with other frameworks or "vanilla" JavaScript. Generally, however, you should avoid direct DOM manipulation whenever you can, instead using a _Template_ CPart to render the component (otherwise, the _Template_ will override whatever direct manipulation you do!).

### Defining lifecycle callbacks

By naming functions with certain names, you can "hook into" the component
rendering lifecycle with callbacks.

You can define a function with any of the following names and expect it to be
invoked during it's namesake lifecycle phase: `initializedCallback`,
`prepareCallback`, `renderCallback`, `reconcileCallback`, and finally
`updateCallback`.

See below for an example of defining a custom `prepareCallback` in order to
"hook into" the component rendering lifecycle to execute custom code. The
return value of this function is available to the _Template_ CPart when it
renders during the `render` lifecycle.


```modulo_demo
<Template>
    {% for item in script.data %}<p>{{ item }}</p>{% endfor %}
    <p>(C) {{ script.year }} All Rights Reserved</p>
</Template>
<Script>
    function prepareCallback() {
        return {
            data: ["a", "b", "c"],
            year: (new Date()).getFullYear(),
        };
    }
/Script>
```

> **Template literals?** Modern JavaScript has a built-in mini-templating
> system. Learn more at
> [MDN's Template literals
> reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

For fine-grained control over a component's rendered HTML, you can hook into
the renderCallback.  While not recommended for most usage, it remains an option
to use the renderCallback to write JS that constructs the HTML in a custom
fashion, such as using a third party templating system, or simply using
template literals.

Another option is to use this to, for example, use backtick template literals
for templating, if for whatever reason Modulo's templating language is
insufficient. See below:


```modulo_demo
<State
    name="Ha-Joon Chang"
    books:='[ "Edible Economics", "Kicking Away the Ladder" ]'
></State>
<Script>
   function renderCallback() {
        component.innerHTML = `
            <p>Author: ${ state.name }</p>
            <ol>${
                state.books.map(title => `
                    <li>${ title }</li>
                `).join('')
            }</ol>
        `;
    }
/Script>
```


### Defining directive callbacks

You can also create "custom directives" from within the Script tag. Read more
about this in the section on [Directives](/docs/directives.html)

### Execution context

#### Static execution context (default)

By default, the `factory` phase is when the code in the script tag itself gets executed. That is, it is executed exactly once while the component class is being prepared, before anything is yet even mounted on the document. This means that that any loose variables defined will be "static", or shared between all instances of that component.

**Static execution _Script_ tags will only correctly isolate synchronous
code.** It is thus recommended to keep your _Script_ tag to only contain
synchronous code, that is, no async callbacks. This is an intentional
limitation, as _Script_ tags are intended for _synchronously_ patching together
behavior around potentially _asynchronous_ CParts. There is also a potential
for a bug: If there are multiple instances of the same component on the same
page, with async callbacks ready at the same time, it can cause the wrong
state, props or other variables or CParts to get mixed up and go to the wrong
component. Asynchronous coding should be thus moved to a custom CPart, that is
then used in the script tag in a declarative, synchronous manner. The CPart API
gives you low-level access, and makes no assumptions about using a synchronous
or asynchronous coding style.

That said, Modulo is intended to be useful as a glue language and it's common
to find asynchronous snippets that you might want to quickly integrate into an
existing component. Read on for a few ways to bend this rule in order to better
integrate third party code.

#### Lifecycle execution context

> **ALPHA API NOTE:** This feature might be renamed in a future release of
> Modulo alpha:
> [See Issue #26](https://github.com/modulojs/modulo/issues/26)

##### Per component: `lifecycle="initialized"`

Setting `lifecycle="initialized"` behaves very similarly to the "static"
execution context (the default): For both, functions defined there will be
available to be attached to events, and you can define Callback and Mount and
Unmount functions. However, there is one important difference: It will execute
_each and every time_ an instance of the component first mounts on the page.
That is, it will run everything in that script tag once per component use. This
keeps all the data in the script tag private to that component, allowing for
asynchronous code.

It also allows use of the private variables as a sort of state. That is not
recommended usage, but might be useful for integrating with other JavaScript
state or store management systems.

### renderObj

The Script CPart "exports" a variety of properties to the `renderObj`, all of which should be considered "read-only".

* `script.someFunctionName` for functions declared like
  `function someFunctionName` \- In addition to "exports", the script tag will
  also make available all functions that you have declared using the
  "old-school" named-function style syntax. This is what allows attaching
  events to be so simple: Simply define a named-function in your script tag
  (e.g.  `function doStuff(payload, ev) { ...`), and then it can be referenced
  elsewhere (e.g. in the template with: `@click:=script.doStuff` template with
  a click event like: It will ignore any "arrow functions" (`() => {}`), or any
  other anonymous functions (e.g. functions declared like
  `const myFunc = function () { ...` will also be ignored). That's not to say
  you can't declare your functions like this: However, you should only do so if
  you do not want them to be automatically exported.
