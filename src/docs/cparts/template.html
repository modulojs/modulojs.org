title: Template - CParts
---

# Template

The _Template_ CPart allow components to render their HTML content using a
tiny domain-specific language, called the _Modulo Templating Language_.

Without a _Template_ CPart (or equivalent custom code), the default behavior of
the _Component_ CPart is to make no attempt to alter their contents. However,
most components require complicated HTML structures within them. This is where
Templates come into play: They generate the `innerHTML` of a component.

Templates are not DOM-based, but instead render synchronously to a String
during the `render` [lifecycle phase](/docs/lifecycle.html), and
store the results in `renderObj.component.innerHTML`. The _Component_ CPart
will read this HTML code during the `reconcile` phase and then "reconcile",
modify it's contents to resemble the target innerHTML. (More on this is in [the
Component CPart documentation above](/docs/core.html#component).)

Every time a Component renders, the Template will render using the _renderObj_
as a "template context", or, in other words, using the various CPart's
contributions to the _renderObj_ as Template variables that can be inserted
into the HTML.

## Usage example


```modulo_demo
<Template>
<p>There are <em>{{ state.count }}
  {{ state.count|pluralize:"articles,article" }}</em>.</p>

{# Show the articles #}
{% for article in state.articles %}
    <h4 style="color: blue">{{ article.headline|upper }}</h4>
    {% if article.tease %}
      <p>{{ article.tease|truncate:30 }}</p>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</Template>

<!-- The data below was used to render the template above -->
<State
    count:=42
    articles:='[
      {"headline": "Modulo released!",
       "tease": "The most exciting news of the century."},
      {"headline": "Can JS be fun again?"},
      {"headline": "MTL considered harmful",
       "tease": "Why constructing JS is risky business."}
    ]'
></State>
```
