title: Templating Language
---


This document explains the language syntax and functionality of the included
Modulo template system.


##### Approach


Modulo's templating language is designed to be fairly versatile in
capabilities, while still feel comfortable to those only used to working with
HTML. If you have any exposure to other similar template languages, such as
Django (Python), Shopify's Liquid (Ruby), Hugo (Go), Jinja2 (Python), Nunjucks
(JavaScript), or Twig (PHP), you should feel right at home with Modulo's
templates. In fact, Modulo's templating was modeled so closely on Django's,
that much of this documentation was [heavily inspired by Django's own
documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/).
This also means that most text editors already can highlight Modulo template
code: Just configure your editor to syntax highlight _Django HTML templates_,
and you'll be all set for editing Modulo template or library files. Thanks,
Django!



If you are used to frontend frameworks which permit mixing functions and
imperative code directly with DOM elements, such as with React.js or Svelte, or
using XML-based DOM construction syntax, like JSX, then there is an important
difference to note: Modulo templates are string-based, and intended to
resembled declarative mark-up. When compared to a general language like
JavaScript (which Modulo templates compile into), it's intentionally limited:
While the Modulo template language provides "template tags" that resemble
programming constructs (`if`, `for`, etc), it does not permit any embedded
JavaScript, but instead only a few constructs and operations.

This declarative, string-based templating paradigm was chosen with the same
reason behind the MVC paradigm: "To separate internal representations of
information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the
user".  Supporting pure-text output enforces this clear wall of separation
between presentation and business logic. Furthermore, this will be more
familiar to backend developers more familiar with string-based templating in
general (such as Ruby, Python, or PHP developers).

# Templates

A "template" is the text within a Template CPart. Most Components defined
within Modulo will also define a Template CPart in order to render their
contents.

A template contains variables, which get replaced with values when the template
is evaluated, and tags, which control the logic of the template.

Below is a minimal template that illustrates a few basics. Each element will be
explained later in this document.

```modulo_demo
<Template>
<h1>{{ script.title }}</h1>
<p>There are <em>{{ state.count }}
  {{ state.count|pluralize:"articles,article" }}.</em></p>

{# Show the articles #}
{% for article in state.articles %}
    <h4 style="color: tomato">{{ article.headline|upper }}</h4>
    {% if article.tease %}
      <p>{{ article.tease|truncate:30 }}</p>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</Template>

<!-- The data below was used to render the template above -->
<State
    count:=42
    articles:=[]
    articles.0:={}
    articles.1:={}
    articles.2:={}
    articles.0.headline="Modulo released"
    articles.1.headline="Modulo released"
    articles.2.headline="Modulo released"
    articles.0.tease="The most exciting news of the century."
    articles.1.tease="Can JS be fun again?"
    articles.2.tease="Why constructing JS is risky business."
></State>

<Script>
    function prepareCallback() {
        return {
            title: "Modulo News",
        }
    }
/Script>
```


# Variables

Variables look like this: `{{ variable }}`. When the template engine encounters
a variable, it evaluates that variable and replaces it with the result.
Variable names consist of any combination of alphanumeric characters and the
underscore ("_") but may not start with an underscore, and may not be a number.
The dot (".") also appears in variable sections, although that has a different
meaning, as indicated below. Importantly, you cannot have spaces or punctuation
characters in variable names.

### The dot (.)

Use a dot (.) to access sub-properties of a variable. This syntax is much like JavaScript.

In the above example, `{{ state.count }}` will be replaced with the value of the "count" property of the state data. Similarly, `{{ script.exports.title }}` reaches even further, by first accessing the `script` variable, then the `exports` subproperty, then the `title` subproperty.

If you use a variable that doesn't exist, the template system will insert the value of `undefined`, much like in JavaScript.

Note that "bar" in a template expression like `{{ foo.bar }}` will be interpreted as a literal string property of "foo', and not a variable "bar", even if one exists in the template context. If you wish to to do the opposite behavior, that is, actually resolve "bar" into it's own value, and then use that value to access a property of bar, consider using the `get` filter: `{{ foo|get:bar }}`. This is equivalent to the "square brackets" notation of JavaScript (e.g. `foo[bar]`), and thus is also useful for accessing numeric indices. For an example, if we have an array in our state like `foo:='["a", "b", "c"]'`, then we can access `"b"` as follows: `{{ state.foo|get:1 }}`.

Variable attributes that begin with an underscore should generally not be accessed, as that can be used to indicate private.

### What variables are available

Variables come from the component's `renderObj` that is produced in the `prepare` lifecycle phase. [More on the "renderObj" in the section on lifecycle.](/docs/directives.html#renderobj) In practicality, this is another way to say that most variables typically "come from" the CParts of a component. That is, `state` will provide the state values, `props` will provide the values passed down to this component, and finally `script` will provide variables from script tags. In other words, each CPart "decides" which variables it supplies to the Template based on it's "prepare" lifecycle behavior. See the "Variables from CParts" section below for a more thorough look at this.

### Custom variables using the _Script_ "prepare" callback

If you want to create computed variables (like in Vue.js), you can create a custom `prepare` lifecycle callback in your Script CPart tag as follows. Examine the following example:


```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <input name="perc" [state.bind] />% of
    <input name="total" [state.bind] />
    is: {{ script.calcResult }}
</Template>

<State
    perc:=50
    total:=30
></State>

<Script>
    function prepareCallback() {
        const calcResult = (state.perc / 100) * state.total;
        return { calcResult };
    }
/Script>

<Style>
    input { display: inline; width: 25px }
</Style>
```

Note that in some cases you may instead want to make a custom template filter (see below, in the section *Filter).

#### Variables from CParts

Each _CPart_ within a given component may contribute a variable to the _Template_. Of the built-in CParts, the following contribute a variable with useful data:

* **Props** \- If the _Props_ CPart is present, then you will have a `{{ props }}` variable available. This gives access to the current value of props data. For example, `{{ props.title }}` gives access to the current value of the "title" attribute of the component.
* **State** \- If the _State_ CPart is present, then you will have a `{{ state }}` variable available. This gives access to the current value of state data, the object that represents state. For example, `{{ state.number }}` gives access to the current value of the "number" property of state.
* **Script** \- If the _Script_ CPart is present, then you will have a `{{ script }}` variable available. The main uses of this for access to computed variables from the `prepareCallback`. Another use is to access `script.exports` variable as a way to store global, static data shared between all instances of a component.

#### Variables from templatetags

We'll go over template-tags later, but some template-tags can add variables into the mix as well. As a sneak-peak, examine the following code:

Note how `athlete` declares a new variable, which can be reused in
`{{ athlete.name }}`. For more on for-loops, see the
[built-in template-tag reference.](/docs/templating/tags.html#for)


```
{% for athlete in state.athletes %}
    <p>{{ athlete.name }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

# Filters

You can modify variables for display by using filters.

Filters look like this: `{{ name|lower }}`. This displays the value of the `{{
name }}` variable after being filtered through the lower filter, which converts
text to lowercase. Use a pipe (|) to apply a filter.

Filters can be "chained." The output of one filter is applied to the next. This
chaining feature can be applied to combine behavior of two or more filters. For
example, using a filter chain like
`{{ state.color|allow:"red,blue"|default:"green" }}` is a way to conditionally
allow for only certain strings to be in `state.color`, while providing a
default if none were specified.

Some filters take arguments. A filter argument looks like this: `{{
state.bio|truncate:30 }}`. This will display the first 30 characters of the bio
variable, possibly appending an ellipsis if its full length exceeds that.

Filter arguments that contain spaces must be quoted; for example, to join a
list with commas and spaces you'd use `{{ state.list|join:", " }}`.

Modulo's templating language provides many built-in template filters.
You can read all about them in the 
[built-in filter reference](/docs/templating/filters.html).

## Example filter: default

To give you an idea of what a filter might be useful for, one popular filter to
use as an example is the `|default` filter.  This filter shows the variable if
it has a value. However, if a variable is false, empty, or 0, it will use a
default value instead.  For example:

```
{{ value|default:"None specified." }}
```

If value isn't provided or is empty, the above will display "nothing".


Again, these are just a few examples; see the [built-in filter reference](/docs/template-reference.html#builtinfilters). for the complete list.


## Custom filters

See below for an example of registering a custom filter:


```modulo_demo
<Template>
    A: {{ state.a|percent:state.total }}<br />
    B: {{ state.b|percent:state.total }}
</Template>

<State
    a:=3
    b:=13
    total:=42
></State>

<Script>
    modulo.register('templateFilter', function percent(value, arg) {
    	const number = (value / 100) * arg;
        return  `${ number }% of ${ arg }`;
    });
/Script>
```

# Tags

Tags look like this: `{% tag %}` (except with the word "tag" replaced with something else). Tags can be more complex than variables: Some create text in the output, some control flow by performing loops or logic, and some load external information into the template to be used by later variables.

Most built-in tags require beginning and ending tags, in the format of: `{% tag %}...contents...{% endtag %}`

Modulo ships with several built-in template-tags. You can read all about them
in the [built-in template-tag reference](/docs/templating/tags.html).


## Common Template-Tags

Here are a couple commonly used template-tags:

#### for

Duplicate a block of HTML code for every item in a collection of items (e.g. an array). This allows a HTML code to be repeated while looping over each item in an array. For example, to display a list of athletes, assuming one was stored as an array of objects within `state.athletes`:

```
<ul>
    {% for athlete in state.athletes %}
        <li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

#### if

Evaluates a variable, and if that variable is "true" the contents of the block are displayed:

```
{% if state.athletes %}
    Number of athletes: {{ state.athletes|length }}
{% endif %}
```

In the above, if state.athletes is not empty, the number of athletes will be displayed by the `{{ state.athletes|length }}` variable.

You can also use filters and various operators in the if tag:

```
{% if state.athletes|length gt 1 %}
   Team: {% for athlete in state.athletes %} ... {% endfor %}
{% else %}
   Athlete: {{ state.athletes|first }}
{% endif %}
```

### Final notes on tags

The most important difference between template tags and template filters are
that template tags are interpreted at "compile-time" (when the template is
first loaded or when you are building a JavaScript build or bundle), while
filters are interpreted at "render-time" (when the component is outputting it's
HTML into the DOM). This means that mistakes with template tags might stop the
component from rendering at all (mistakes such as syntax typo or a buggy
third-party template tag), while mistakes with filters may only be detected
when it tries using it, and could even be overlooked if the filter doesn't get
used, e.g. it's only within an if statement that you haven't tested.


### Custom tags

Just like filters, you can also create your own custom template tags.  Custom
tags are more difficult to write, since they are run during build time (not
during "run time", like filters). That means they need to *generate* the
JavaScript code that *does what you want*, as opposed to *do what you want
directly*. To register a template tag, be sure to register it at the top level,
since it will be needed during build time:

```
<script Configuration>
    modulo.register('templateTag', function console_logger (text, templateCPart) {
        // Simply return "console.log" code to show the variable given
        return `console.log(CTX.${ text.trim() });`,
    });
/script>

<Component>
    <Template>
        {% for value of state.data %}
            {% console_logger value %}
        {% endfor %}
    </Template>

    <State
        data:='[3, 10, 42]'
    ></State>
</Component>
```


# Comments

To comment-out part of a line in a template, use the comment syntax: `{# text in here is ignored #}`. This syntax should only be used for single-line comments. Due to this, it's not intended for "commenting out" or disabling portions of template code.

If you need to comment out a multiline portion of the template, especially a block of other template code, use the comment tag syntax instead. This looks like: `{% comment %}text in here is ignored{% endcomment %}`

Examples of both are below:

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <h1>hello {# greeting #}</h1>
    {% comment %}
      {% if a %}<div>{{ b }}</div>{% endif %}
      <h3>{{ state.items|first }}</h3>
    {% endcomment %}
    <p>Below the greeting...</p>
</Template>
```

# Debugging

Modulo templates generate JavaScript code which mirrors the logic found in the
template. Like all generated code in Modulo, it gets appended to the `<head>`
as a `<script>` tag. When inspecting the resulting JavaScript code, note the
JavaScript comments to each line indicating the Templating text that
corresponds, so if a Modulo template is behaving unexpectedly, you can examine
the actual code getting generated.

Modulo templates also come equipped with the `{% debugger %}` template tag.
This will insert a `debugger;` JavaScript statement. This "freezes" your app in
time. After halting execution at the given statement, your browser's Developer
Tools will allow you to inspect the values of local variables in the generated
Template code itself. Note that the `CTX` variable refers to the Template
render context (which, in the case of Modulo components, refers to the
`renderObj`, or the object that has `script`, `state` etc. properties generated
by component parts). This is typically what you'll want to poke around on to
figure out why something is broken. Example below, with a comment hinting at a
story as to why the debugger was used:

```
{% for item in state.data %}
    {{ item.user_id }} {# Bug: Keeps on coming back as "undefined" #}
    {% debugger %}
{% endfor %}
```

**Note:** For obvious reasons, it's very important to remember to delete all your "debugger" statements before you release your code, or your app may freeze for other people as well.

# Escaping

By default in Modulo, every template automatically escapes the output of every variable value. Specifically, these five characters are escaped:

* `>` is converted to `&lt;`
* `<` is converted to `&gt;`
* `'` (single quote) is converted to `&#x27;`
* `"` (double quote) is converted to `&quot;`
* `&` is converted to `&amp;`

## Why escape

When generating HTML from templates, there's always a risk that a variable will
include characters that affect the resulting HTML. For example, consider this
template fragment:

```
<p>Hello, {{ state.name }}</p>
```

Imagine if a user were to enter their name as `</p><h1>Big`. If the template system were to insert that value directly, without modification, it would result in the P tag getting closed prematurely, and a H1 tag taking over, making the text large.

Clearly, user-submitted data shouldn't be inserted directly into your Web pages, at least without some sort of validation. A malicious user could even use this vulnerability to add in JavaScript behavior that acts on behalf of other users, such as by sending requests to an API. To avoid this problem, Modulo uses automatic escaping.

## How to turn it off

Sometimes template variables contain trusted data that you actually intend to be rendered as raw HTML, in which case you don't want their contents to be escaped. For example, you might want to render a string of HTML in your state that was generated by JS on the front-end, or a string of HTML loaded from a trusted source, such as a staff-only database.

To disable auto-escaping for an individual variable, use the safe filter:

```
This will be escaped: {{ state.content }}
This will not be escaped: {{ state.content|safe }}
```

Think of safe as shorthand for safe from further escaping or can be safely interpreted as HTML. In this example, if `state.content` was defined like `content="<b>"'`, the output will be:

```
This will be escaped: &lt;b&gt;
This will not be escaped: &lt;b&gt;
```

Keep in mind that you should only mark trusted data as `|safe`. You don't want anyone trying to slip in malicious JS behavior! How to validate if a bit of HTML is safe to include verbatim (e.g. with `|safe`) is outside the scope of this document, but generally you should only trust HTML that has been validated on the backend or database, whitelisting only certain features of HTML and checking for "red flags" like embedded JavaScript code, or if it's a "staff-only" feature like a team blog, and thus the content generated is only editable by a trusted source (e.g. yourself or a member of your team). Examine the code below for a concrete example of how this escaping behaves:


```modulo_demo
<Template>
<p>User "<em>{{ state.username }}</em>" sent a message:</p>
<div class="msgcontent">
    {{ state.content|safe }}
</div>
</Template>
<State
    username="Little <Bobby> <Drop> &tables"
    content='
        I <i>love</i> the classic <a target="_blank"
        href="https://xkcd.com/327/">xkcd #327</a> on
        the risk of trusting <b>user inputted data</b>
    '
></State>
<Style>
    .msgcontent {
        background: #999;
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
    }
</Style>
```
