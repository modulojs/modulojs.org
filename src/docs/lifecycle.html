title: Lifecycle
---


Every Modulo Component goes through a certain "lifecycle". Here's an analogy:
If CParts are the stage-hands and actors who put on a play, then the
"lifecycle" is the pre-described arrangement of each "act", intermission, and
so on, such that every CPart stage-hand "jumps in" at the right moment to do
it's job and set up for the next act.

# Component lifecycle

Every _Component_ that you define triggers a certain set of lifecycle phases.
The lifecycle phases that a Modulo _Component_ progresses through can be
categorized into a few groups. One way to think of these phases is that
typically, the "output" of a previous lifecycle phase in a group is the "input"
of the next phase. As an example, `prepare` figures out the template variables,
`render` causes the template to actually perform the render based on the
variables in the previous phase, and `update` updates the HTML of the element
based on the rendered output of the previous phase.



## Mount Lifecycle

Several methods are triggered when a component is mounted on the page. Note
that for most components, you'll want to only use *initializedCallback*, unless
you want to customize any aspects of how the component hydrates from a built
version of the page. 


* _constructor()_ \- While technically not a lifecycle method, the
  constructor() method will be invoked when creating an instance of the CPart
  class. This happens _before_ the Component's HTML Element is guaranteed to be
  fully loaded on the DOM, and _before_ injected properties (e.g. ".conf",
  ".modulo", ".element") properties are set on the CPart instance.
* `constructed` \- Also technically not a lifecycle method, but this will be
  called _before_ the Component's HTML Element is fully parsed, but _after_
  injected properties (e.g. ".conf", ".modulo", ".element") properties are set
  on the CPart instance.
* `mount` \- The first "regular" lifecycle method. The *Component* class will
  use this phase for hydrating content from a SSR'ed version of the page. This
  is useful to hook in code to activate before any further DOM modifications
  happen, but after the HTML Element and it's contents are fully parsed.
* `mountRender` \- The *Component* will use this callback to "take . Useful if
  you want to hook in code right before the _prepare_ of the first rerender
  (described below), and maybe adding code to cancel the first rerender.
* `initialized` \- Happens once per instance, every time a component is fully
  mounted (i.e. used) on a page, but before the first render. Useful for
  fetching or setting up initial data on a component, as all the component will
  be fully ready for use at this point.

## Render Lifecycle

All of 5 these lifecycle phases trigger in the following sequence every time a
component renders. This including the first time, every manual rerender (e.g.
invoking `element.rerender()`), and ever automatic rerender (e.g. after events
or state manipulation). These will phases even trigger if you don't have a
_Template_ CPart defined (although without a _Template_ there will be nothing
to render, _per se_).

* `prepare` \- Gather data needed before rendering (e.g. gather variables for
  template). Return values from here to have "computed variables" within the
  Template and Script code.
* `render` \- The Template CPart will use this phase to to render HTML code
  from the template specified (by setting `renderObj.component.innerHTML`
* `dom` \- A DOM fragment is constructed for comparison during the reconcile
  phase. Usefuly for doing direct DOM modification, but before directives are
  activated (e.g. to do a `setAttribute('data:=', '{"a": 3}')` and expect the
  `dataProp` to be in effect).
* `reconcile` \- The Component CPart will compare the new rendered DOM fragment
  to the document's actual DOM, and generates a "patch-set" or array of
  operations necessary to reconcile the DOM to the new HTML (by setting
  `renderObj.component.patches`)
* `update` \- Finally, the Component will apply the patch-set generated in the
  previous step, actually modifying the DOM and invoking any directive
  callbacks specified


## Directives

Directives can can cause lifecycle phases as well. With the built-in CParts,
there is only one directive that will trigger any lifecycle phases: The `event`
directive (e.g. `@click`). More information on directives is [covered in the
Directives section](/docs/directives.html).

**Note:** These are ONLY available for full-fledged Component Parts written in
JavaScript. They cannot be used in an embedded script tag, since the *Script*
CPart does not support it.

* `event` \- Triggers when an event is about to happen.
* `eventCleanup` \- Triggers after an event happened. A common pattern is to use this and the previous to figure out what has "changed" due to the event, and respond accordingly.

# Lifecycle Callbacks

The purpose of _lifecycle phases_ is the _lifecycle methods_ or callback functions that "hook into" each phase and run during them.

You can get the name for a _lifecycle method_ by simply suffixing the name of the phase with the word `Callback`. For example, `prepare` thus becomes `function prepareCallback() {...`. Every CPart has the ability to hook into lifecycle methods by defining a method with an expected name. This is useful for CPart developers to implement the actual behavior and functionality of a CPart. In fact, most of CPart code is just hooking into these different methods!

The _Script_ CPart also exposes this interface to component developers. This is so that you can write custom code in each component to execute during any one of the phases. Note that you cannot hook into the global phases (e.g., prebuild, define, factory) this way, since those need to happen before your script tag is even ready.

Directives also have callback functions, [covered in a the directive section](/docs/directives.html).


### renderObj

> **renderObj is like "req"** \- `renderObj` is comparable to the "request" or "response" objects in many backend MVC frameworks, such as in Express.js or Django. In these, middleware works behind the scenes to modify or construct the "request" object. They prepare it for the controller functions that accept it as an argument, by attaching data and injecting dependencies. For a concrete example, enabling Express's JSON parsing middleware adds the `req.json` attribute to request objects, for parsing of JSON data.
> 
> This is what inspired the `renderObj`, which is a plain object that gets passed along throughout the lifecycle phases. The Component Parts act just like middleware in other web frameworks: Work together to construct the `renderObj` for users of the framework.

So far in this document, we covered how lifecycle methods are central to CParts, and that CParts are central to Modulo components in general. Now, we will learn how `renderObj` is central to lifecycle methods. It's how lifecycle methods pass data and communicate, as a component passes through the different phases.

### renderObj and lifecycle

The renderObj goes through 3 phases. The first is during set-up, the second during component factory initialization, and the third happens every time a component rerenders.

1.  `initRenderObj` \- This is the version created during the `initialized`
phase
2.  `renderObj` \- This is the one that component developers are more likely to
encounter. During first render, and every time a `.rerender()` method is
called, `renderObj` is duplicated from the `initRenderObj`, and then gets
passed around through the `prepare` / `render` /  etc phases.

Typically, unless developing new CParts, you will have little need to directly
interact with the `renderObj`, but instead will use implicitly just about
everywhere.  For example, whenever you access variables in the _Script_ CPart,
the `state` variable is in fact shorthand for `element.renderObj.state`, or
whenever you access [variables in the
template](/docs/templating.html#variables) _CPart_ (e.g., `props.text` is
shorthand for `element.renderObj.props.text`). So, if you are a component
developer and not a CPart developer, and you find yourself thinking that it
doesn't make a lot of sense why you'd need to access or modify the `renderObj`
explicitly... You probably don't!

Nevertheless, use the following example to examine the output of the following
example to see what information is available or modified at each step:


```modulo_demo
<Template>
<label>
<input [state.bind] name="enabled" type="checkbox" />
Show messages in console</label>
</Template>

<State
    enabled:=false
></State>

<Script>
    function _logInfo(message, renderObj) {
        // Little helper function to do messages in console
        if (state.enabled) {
            const formattedOutput = JSON.stringify(renderObj, null, 2);
            console.log(message, formattedOutput);
        }
    }

    function prepareCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo("prepareCallback:",  renderObj);
    }

    function renderCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo("renderCallback:", renderObj);
    }

    function reconcileCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo("reconcileCallback:", renderObj);
    }

    function updateCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo("updateCallback:", renderObj);
    }
/Script>
```
