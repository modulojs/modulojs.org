# Processors

**Definition processors** are a feature of Modulo that allows for component
parts and other definitions to have allow for special attributes that trigger
certain behavior. They are commonly used for configuring, loading, or
tranforming definitions.

Definition processors are conventionally prefixed with a dash (that is, `-`).
This distinguishes them from regular attributes. Some processors can only be
used with a certain type of component parts or definitions. For example,
examine the `-store=` processor for _State_:

```
<State
    -store="userdata"
    username="crash0veride"
></State>
```

Others are supported by all component parts. For example, examine the `-src=`
processor for loading content from external files.


```modulo
<Template -src="my-template.html"></Template>
<Style -src="fancy-look.css"></Style>
```



## Behavior

Definition processors have two important rules of behavior:

- Definition processors are applied _before_ anything else is loaded. That is,
  _every_ processor finishes its tasks before any components are mounted on the
  screen.

- Definition processors are _not_ run in built or packed scripts. That is, the
  definitions stored in the compiled JS file are "pre-processed", and thus the
  processor only will run during development or when building.



# Built-in Processors


> **Why no dash for `<Component name="...">`?** Note that for _Component_, you
> use `name=` (without the `-`), and use a valid JavaScript identifier as the
> Web Component name. However, that behavior is specific to the _Component_
> definition, and is not available on Component Parts or other definitions.
> Definition types (e.g. [core definitions](/docs/core/) like _Library_ or a
> [component parts](/docs/cparts/) like _State_) can each specify their own,
> unique behavior for processors.



## -name

* Supported by: **All Definitions** 

The `-name` directive allows you to override the default name that Modulo will
generate with something else. This allows you to have multiple Component Parts
of the same type without conflict.

For a simple example, see below:

```modulo
<Template -name="footer_template">
```

### Example: `-name` for multiple Component Parts

Note that _Template_ has special behavior around `-name`. If you specify a
name, it will _not_ by default still render, since it will assume you are going
to include it somewhere else.




```modulo_demo
<Template>
    {# This becomes the "primary template" (named "template") #}
    <h3>Welcome to my blog</h3>
    <p>Things I like: {{ likes_data }}</p>
    <p>Things I dislike: {{ dislikes_data }}</p>
    {% include footer_template %}
</Template>
<Template -name="footer_template">
    {# This becomes a non-primary template (named "footer_template") #}
    <p>(C) 2095 Tux the Penguin</p>
</Template>
<StaticData -name="likes_data">
    [ "Fish", "radishes", "hackable software" ]
</StaticData>
<StaticData -name="dislikes_data">
    [ "Wet towels" ]
</StaticData>
```



## -src

* Supported by: **All Definitions**

```modulo
<Template
    -src="./MyComponent/MyComponent.html"
></Template>
<Script -src="https://unpkg.com/snarkdown">
   modulo.register("templateFilter", snarkdown);
/Script>
<Style
    -src="./MyComponent/MyComponent.css"
></Style>
```



Note that the -src= combines the retrieved content with whatever is embedded
between the opening and closing tag. It _does not_ replace the embedded
content, but instead places the retrieved content before content _BEFORE_ the
embedded content. This ordering is important, since it allows the internal
content to "extend" the content that is being brought in. 

### -src for extension

The `-src` attribute is designed to allow for many types of "inheritence" or a
sort of primitive extension, depending on the CPart. For example, _Components_
can "inherit" CParts of base components (e.g., the _Template_ and _Script_
could be the same across two _Components_, but they only differ in _Style_), or
_Style_ can "inherit" another style file, but get to append some modifications
to the end.  (e.g., loading from a third party, then override certain
properties). Similarly, _Library_ or _Modulo_ can load entire Modulo libraries,
and then apply _Configuration_ scripts at the end to modify configuration
settings within that other libraries' execution context.


## -filter-content

* Supported by: **Template** (Alpha 71), **StaticData**, **Style** (Alpha 72+)


Allows you to apply [template filters](/templating/filters.html) at load time.


### Example 1: Trim excess code

For example, you could use `trim` to remove excess characters from a
_Template_. For example, here we load content from an external document file,
and then use `|trim` to remove "boilerplate" that we know exists at the
beginning of the file that we don't want to include:

```modulo
<Template
    -src="/my-html-doc.html"
    -filter-content="trim:'<!doctype><html>,</html>'"
></Template>
```


### Example 2: Style template with trim


By defining a `style Template`, we can template style for inclusion. By using
`trim` we can use a placeholder of `x { .. }` to make editing this CSS easier
to read. Note that this is, in fact, a _Template_ CPart, however, we will use a
`style` initial tag to make it easier to read and syntax highlight.

See below for a concrete example of how to use this technique for making a
quick button designer component:

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <label><input [state.bind] name="bg" type="color" /> Color</label>
    <label><input [state.bind] name="size" type="range" min="5" max="20" /> Size</label>
    <button style="{% include button_style %}">Sample Button</button>
    <pre>button { {% include button_style %} }</pre>
</Template>

<style Template -filter-content="trim:'x {,}'" -name="button_style">
x {
    background-color: {{ state.bg }};
    font-size: {{ state.size }}px;
}
</style>

<State
    bg="#a0caa0"
    size:=10
></State>
```



### Example 3: Tagswap for `<table>`


Modulo uses HTML syntax for most everything. This, unfortunately, means that
`<table>` tags can behave differently when it comes to how content is processed
and loaded, causing content to "escape" when you are still just assembling the
initial Template's DOM. Similarly, the closing `script` tag can have special
meanings as well. To get around limitations like this, we can use the
`|tagswap` to convert innocuous placeholder tags into other ones:


```modulo_demo
<Template -filter-content="tagswap:'t=table r=tr d=td'">
    <t>
        <r> <d>Col 1</d> <d>Col 2</d> <d>Col 3</d> </r>
        <r> <d>A</d> <d>B</d> <d>C</d> </r>
        <r> <d>1</d> <d>2</d> <d>3</d> </r>
        <r> <d>X</d> <d>Y</d> <d>Z</d> </r>
    </t>
</Template>
<Style>
    table {
        border: 2px solid Tomato;
    }
    td {
        border: 1px dotted Tomato;
        padding: 2px;
    }
</Style>
```

This will be applied at load time, so there are ultimately no performance
penalties, as the final JavaScript file will have the tag transpositions "baked
in" (and with no trace of the original template, either).


### Gotcha: Applied at runtime

Remember that it is applied "pre-baked" to the content itself during initial
content load, and NOT at _Template_ run time, meaning it will affect (and
potentially disrupt) the tempting language itself as well (e.g. using
`-filter-content="upper"` will cause `{{ state.stuff }}` to become `{{
STATE.STUFF }}`, which _will not_ work since capitalization matters in this
case).
