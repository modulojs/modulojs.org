title: Directives
---

_Directives_ are one of the core features of Modulo. It allows for callbacks to be triggered when a particular DOM element is "mounted" or first appears in the DOM. It allows for your custom code to access references to DOM nodes created after rendering.

# Directives

Every directive has a name. Every directive is specified as an attribute on the
DOM element that you wish to gain access to, by enclosing the name in square
brackets. For example, the _State_ CPart has the directive named `bind`, making
the full attribute be `[state.bind]`. Some directives have shortcut names. For
example, `[component.event]` can be shortened to only a single at-sign, `@`.

Directives also have callback functions. Just like lifecycle callbacks, a
directive callback name is created by suffixing a string to the end of the name
of the directive. Unlike lifecycle callback functions, directive callback
functions end with `Mount` and `Unmount`.

### Built-in directives vs custom directives

Modulo ships with a total of 3 built-in directives, defined by the built-in
_CParts_ (1 from _State_ and 2 from _Component_). Typically, the built-in
directives are all you need. However, just like with lifecycle functions, the
_Script_ CPart also exposes the directive interface to component developers.
This is so that you can create custom directives in a component to access the
DOM after rendering.

# Built-in directives

* `[component.dataProp]` (_shortcut:_ suffix `:`) \- Attach data to a DOM element's `.dataProp` object, which can be used to directly pass `renderObj` values as _Props_ or events
    * Symbols: `ev:=script.gotClicked`, `data:=state.dataArray`,
      `blogs:=props.blogArray` etc - Data-props can attach any values that are
      exposed in the `renderObj` by any CPart in your component. Use JavaScript
      reference notation, e.g. `state.objdata.prop1` would access something
      like `<State objdata:='{"prop1": "my data"}'>`
    * Primitives: `arr:=[]`, `obj:={}` `boo:=true`, `num:=3`, etc - The
      data-prop can also be used to attach any data in JSON format (whatever
      "JSON.parse" can parse).
* `[component.event]` (_shortcut:_ prefix `@`) \- Attach event listeners to DOM
  elements, and remove them when the DOM elements are removed. (For jQuery
  users, this is used for similar purposes as "live" (delegated) events, but is
  faster.)
    * `payload=...` \- By assigning to the "payload" property, either with a
      regular HTML attribute or a `:=` data-prop, you can provide extra
      arguments to events.
    * `click.payload=...`, `mouseover.payload=...`, etc - If you have multiple
      events attached, you can attach separate payloads by prefixing the
      "payload" attribute with the name of the event followed by a dot.
* `[state.bind]` \- Two-way binding with _State_ data, with the key determined
  by the `name=` property of whatever it is attached to.

Important directive facts: Directives are discovered during the `reconcile` lifecycle phase when DOM reconciliation is occurring, and invoked during the `update` phase. Note that they are independent of the _Template_ CPart: You can have a component that has no _Template_ but still may employ directives, e.g. if it generates HTML contents some other way.

# Custom directives

> **Custom directives are like "refs"** \- Directives have the same uses as Refs in [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html): “Managing focus, text selection, or media playback, triggering imperative animations, or integrating with third-party DOM libraries.”

Custom directives are used for direct access to the DOM. They are invoked when a particular element is first rendered on the screen (`Mount`), invoked when that attribute has any changes (e.g. the value gets changed, also `Mount`), and also invoked when about to be removed from the document (`Unmount`). This allows you to do custom set-up or tear-down code for particular elements, such as to attach third-party JavaScript frameworks in a convenient manner.

### Registering Mount callback

Custom directives can be easily registered in _Script_ CParts simply by
defining a function with a certain name. For example, for a directive called
`myinput` directive, you can create a function like such:

```javascript
function myinputMount(opts) {
  // ...
}
```

Similarly, If you want to register custom code when an element leaves the
screen, such as to clean up references, you can register an Unmount callback:

```javascript
function myinputUnmount(opts) {
  // ...
}
```

##### Example 1: Mount variables

For a simple example that shows the variables avaialble:

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <div [script.myinput]myattr="my value"></div>
</Template>

<Script>
    function myinputMount(opts) {
        const { el, attrName, value } = opts;
        // Uncomment below to see console logs:
        /*
        console.log("element mounted:", el);
        console.log("with attribute:", attrName);
        console.log("and value:", value);
        */
    }
/Script>
```


##### Example 2: Storing Ref

A full, working example is below, which uses a custom directive to focus on an
input when a button is clicked:

**Example custom directives:**


```modulo_demo
<Template>
{# [script.myinput] is a custom directive, defined below #}
<input [script.myinput] />

{# [component.event] is a built-in directive (shortcut is @) #}
<button [component.event]click:=script.showInfo>
    Click me
</button>
</Template>

<Script>
    function myinputMount(mountOptions) {
        element.inputRef = mountOptions.el;
        // Try uncommenting the following to see data:
        //console.log("myinputMount:", mountOptions);
    }

    function showInfo(el) {
        alert("Focusing on:" + String(element.inputRef));
        element.inputRef.focus();
    }
/Script>
```



### Notes on custom directives

- Note that the functions *must* be named exactly like this, including
  capitalization. The attributes, however, are technically not case-sensitive,
  but the JavaScript portion is.
- DOM manipulation is what Templates, and many other features of Modulo, are
  supposed to "save you from". In other words, it gets messy.  This is why the
  it is recommended to try to use the "Modulo" way of State, Templating, and
  re-rendering, to keep things from getting messy.
- Only do direct DOM manipulation as a last resort, such as when you are
  following a tutorial that gives instructions this way, or are combining
  Modulo with another framework that operates with direct DOM references


### Multiple directives

Multiple directives can be attached to the same attribute. For example,
`@click:` has both a `component.event` directive (`@`) and a
`component.dataProp` (`:`) directive. Similarly, multiple custom directives can
be applied to the same attribute. For example:
`[script.hook][script.setup]text="Hello"` would be a valid way to register two
directives(the imaginary `script.hook` and `script.setup` directives, in that
order).

### Mount and Unmount parameters

#### Frequently used

* `el` will contain a reference to the HTML element
* `value` will contain the value you are assigning to the attribute, with any
  previous directives resolved (e.g. if you combine your directive with a `:=`
  dataProp directive, you will already have the "true value" be passed in.)
* `attrName` will contain the bare attribute name, e.g. the portion of the
  attribute name (on the left side of the assignment) without the directive
  syntax

#### Infrequently used

* `name` contains contain the entirety of the attribute name, directive syntax
  included
* `rawName` will typically be the same as `name`. However, if shortcuts were
  applied, `rawName` will show the previous, "unexpanded" verison of the name
  (e.g. without the regular expression substitution applied).
* `directiveName` will contain the name of the current directive being applied
  — typically not useful since we already know that, it's the function's name!

#### Mount and Unmount and multiple directive demonstration

The following demonstration shows both Mount and Unmount callbacks in a script
tag. Note that in this demonstration, the "Mount count" and "Unmount count"
values visually displayed in the `<p>` tags appear to "lag" behind the actual
value — the number of times a Mount or Unmount callback was actually called.
This is because the Mount and Unmount happen _after_ the rendering is complete,
and thus the rendering can only "report" on the previous value.

Uncommenting the "console.log" statements will reveal what arguments and
information are sent along with the callback.


```modulo_demo
<Template>
{% if state.visible %}
    <h1 [script.thing][script.example]attr-name="value example">
        Example H1
    </h1>
    <button @click:=script.hide>(Hide)</button>
{% else %}
    <button @click:=script.show>Show</button>
{% endif %}
<p>Mount count: {{ state.mcount }}</p>
<p>Unmount count: {{ state.ucount }}</p>
</Template>

<State
    visible:=false
    mcount:=0
    ucount:=0
></State>

<Script>
    function show() {
        state.visible = true;
    }

    function hide() {
        state.visible = false;
    }

    function thingMount({ el, value, name, attrName, directiveName, rawName }) {
        //console.log("Element is mounting (thing)");
        //console.log({ el, value, name, attrName, directiveName, rawName });
        state.mcount++;
    }

    function thingUnmount({ el, value, name, attrName, directiveName, rawName }) {
        console.log("Element is unmounting (thing)");
        console.log({ el, value, name, attrName, directiveName, rawName });
        state.ucount++;
    }

    function exampleMount({ el, value, name, attrName, directiveName, rawName }) {
        console.log("Element is mounting (example)");
        console.log({ el, value, name, attrName, directiveName, rawName });
        state.mcount++;
    }

    function exampleUnmount({ el, value, name, attrName, directiveName, rawName }) {
        console.log("Element is unmounting (example)");
        console.log({ el, value, name, attrName, directiveName, rawName });
        state.ucount++;
    }
/Script>
```

## Directive pitfalls

A quick word of caution on custom directives: If you find yourself using custom
directives in _Script_ CParts to do vanilla JS DOM manipulation often, you are
probably doing something wrong!  They are meant as an "emergency escape hatch"
to gain access to the DOM underneath, and typically you only use them while
writing a CPart library, or when you are doing something unusual such as a
situational or unique performacne enhancement in mind that requires direct DOM
manipulation.

### Directives vs. Templates for manipulating DOM

Not sure which to use to manipulate the DOM and generate HTML? Short answer:
Templates! Long answer: Directives deal with direct DOM references, and thus
are almost always messier to use. Modulo's [templating system is
designed](/docs/templating/index.html) to generate a string of HTML code as a
purposeful limitation during the `render` phase, and thus prevents this
messiness with a stricter structure.

So, when you can, try to make the DOM the "source of truth", and attach data to
DOM elements via regular HTML properties or `:=`-style dataProp properties. In
other words, avoid using direct DOM manipulation as your first approach,
instead only using this "escape hatch" to vanilla JS as a last resort.

### Directives and template variables

Don't get confused when attempting to mix _Template_ CPart variables with directives. Directives cannot access template variables, since directives are only are applied after the template is fully rendered and all template variables are already forgotten. As an example, consider the following code:

```
<Template>
    {% for athlete in state.team %}
        {# (HTML Attributes) #}
        {# Broken, will not work: #}
        <a href:=athlete.url>{{ athlete.name }}</a>

        {# Correct, will work: #}
        <a href="{{ athlete.url }}">{{ athlete.name }}</a>

        {# (Events) #}
        {# Also broken, will not work: #}
        <button @click:=athlete.myClickCallback>
            {{ athlete.name }}</button>

        {# Correct, will work: #}
        <button @click:=script.selectOne payload="{{ athlete.id }}">
            {{ athlete.name }}</button>
    {% endfor %}
</Template>
```

The first attempt (HTML Attributes) uses a directive (`[component.dataProp]`,
in this case using the colon `:` shortcut), in an attempt to "directly" attach
the URL to href. The second attempt correctly uses the template variable with
double curly braces to embed it as an actual HTML property. The first attempt
will fail because it fails to take into account that the directives will happen
_after_ rendering the template. That is, the resulting HTML will literally
resemble something like this: “`<a href:=athlete.url>Steph Curry </a> <a
href:=athlete.url>Megan Rapinoe</a> <a href:=athlete.url>Devante Adams</a>`”.

In other words, the "athlete" variable _is a temporary Template variable in the
for loop_ (that is to say, not a variable in the _renderObj_), and will only be
used at the templating step, and forgotten immediately after. Since directives
are only invoked once templating is fully completed, there is no way to resolve
the variable from the for loop.

What is the proper use of the `[component.dataProp]` directive, you might ask?
The proper use is for direct assignment or attachment of values that are not
strings or numbers _at the top level of the renderObj_. Basically, anything
that can't be conveniently serialized into a string attribute. The common usage
is passing down complex nested data types as `Props` (i.e. without having to
clutter the DOM and waste memory with a massive JSON object serialized as an
attribute), or for attaching callbacks from the renderObj.

We see such correct usage in the second (Events) "correct" example: It
references `script.selectAthlete` which is at the global level. We can tell
that it's at the global renderObj level since it starts with `script.`,
referencing the contribution to the renderObj that was provided by the Script
CPart. The issue with this, however, is that we won't know _which_ button was
clicked, since it references one universal `selectAthlete` function. This is
solved by attaching some sort of ID reference to the DOM element as a "payload"
so that the callback function knows which athlete was selected. This is the
correct approach: It uses the DOM as a "source of truth" and is predictable in
behavior, with no "hidden" functions getting attached.



## Rewriting direct DOM manipulation

In this section, the goal is to show how direct DOM manipulation might be more
cumbersome than using Template and other built-in Modulo features. If you are
familiar with vanilla JavaScript, observer how these two approaches differ in
the next section.

### Using direct DOM manipulation

Examine this odd little example of directly attaching click events using the
`onclick` property, without using the Modulo helper "@click", and then directly
using the "textContent" property to modify content.

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    {% for num in state.numbers %}
        <tt [script.explode]>{{ num }}</tt>
    {% endfor %}
</Template>
<State
    numbers:='[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ]'
></State>
<Script>
    function explodeMount({ el }) {
        // console.log('Explode component Mounting:', value);
        let numberToLookFor = Number(el.textContent);
        el.onclick = () => {
            el.textContent = '-(  ( Popped! )  )-';
            setTimeout(() => {
                state.numbers = state.numbers
                    .filter(num => num !== numberToLookFor);
                element.rerender();
            }, 1000); // 1 second!
        }
    }

    function explodeUnmount({ el }) {
        // console.log('Explode component Unmounting:', value);
    }
/Script>
<Style>
    tt {
        background: #aaa;
        display: block;
        border: 1px solid #777;
        padding: 3px;
    }
    :host {
        overflow: auto;
        height: 150px;
        display: block;
    }
</Style>
```


## Rewritten

Here is the previous code rewritten to be a normal click event. Using Modulo's
built-in functionality the code becomes cleaner.


```modulo_demo
<Template>
    {% for num in state.numbers %}
        <tt @click:=script.explode payload="{{ num }}">{{ num }}</tt>
    {% endfor %}
</Template>
<State
    numbers:='[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ]'
></State>
<Script>
    function explode(value) {
        let numberToLookFor = Number(value);
        let index = state.numbers.indexOf(numberToLookFor);
        state.numbers[index] = '-(  ( Popped! )  )-';
        setTimeout(() => {
            state.numbers.splice(index, 1); // cut away 1 item at index
            element.rerender();
        }, 1000); // 1 second!
    }
/Script>
<Style>
    tt {
        background: #aaa;
        display: block;
        border: 1px solid #777;
        padding: 3px;
    }
    :host {
        overflow: auto;
        height: 150px;
        display: block;
    }
</Style>
```
