# Core Definitions

Core definitions can be placed at the top level of Modulo code. That is to say,
the definitions listed here (Artifact, Component, Configuration, and Library)
can all be defined at the top level of file loaded by *Modulo* or
Library, or embedded directly within a Modulo tag in the `<head>` of the
document. Typically, documentation on this page is most useful when you want to
dig into configuring Modulo to behave a certain way across multiple pages, or
interacting with other frameworks and versions.


# Artifact

The *Artifact* definition is how you can specify custom build
artifacts. When the build command is run, Modulo loops through all defined
Artifacts and outputs the files they generate. This is how the JS, CSS, and
HTML files get generated whenever you run build by default. For most users,
this is enough--this website uses the default Artifacts, for example. However,
if you want to create custom build outputs for advanced usage in building a
SSG-powered site, then you can use this feature to create as many extra files
per HTML file you SSG as you'd like. For example, you could loop through
images, generating a "thumbnail" page for each one. It's very versatile, and
gives you the full power of the Modulo templating language for JS, CSS, and
prerendered / SSR'ed HTML.

It manages to be this versatile by functioning as a mini-scripting system
for specifying and configuring builds, allowing for easy addition of
minification, split bundles, or other file types. This gives very fine-grained
control over output in a declarative way.

**Alpha API**: Note that the *Artifact* definition is still in flux. In lieu of
fully documenting while it is being changed, examine the default build
artifacts in DEVLIB.


# Component

> **Low-level interface** - Component developers will typically
only need to use the `name="..."` attribute on *Component*,
and sometimes `mode="vanish-into-document"` for  page-level
components. Similarly, none of the `renderObj.component` properties
are typically useful for component developers. Instead, they are used
internally by CParts (notably *Template*) in order to move along the
rendering cycle.

The *Component* definition is the most central to Modulo. It's how we register
components to be mounted on the page, and define the CParts that go inside
those Components. It's also what stitches together the "machinery" that makes
reconciliation and rendering even possible. In other words, the *Component*  is
what handles the "low-level" operations of mounting, reconciling to generate
patches, and applying those patches to rerender, and the interface described
here allows for low-level manipulation of this process for unusual
circumstances when it's needed.


## renderObj

The Component reads several properties from the `renderObj`, at different
lifecycle phases. Read below on how to interface with it.


* `component.originalHTML` - *Read-only* - This contains the
  initial HTML that the element had when mounted on the page.

* `component.innerHTML` - *Write-only* -
Assign to this to cause the *Component* to attempt to
reconcile the current HTML with the target HTML provided.
It functions a little bit like HTML's built-in *"element.innerHTML"*:
Assign a string containing HTML code to this property to see the HTML
appear on the page. This is what the *Template* does behind
the scenes. Unlike HTML's built-in *"element.innerHTML"*, assigning
to this renderObj property will not cause an full update, overwriting
everything that exists, but instead will cause the *Component* to
employ the "reconciler" specified to generate a patches list (see next). By
default, it will then also apply those patches in the `update`
lifecycle.

* `component.patches` - Between the `reconcile` and `update` stages, the
  "patches" property is exposed to allow access to or modification of the
  patches that the Component intends to apply. This is an advanced feature that
  gives fine-grained control to how rendering works, and thus is only useful in
  rare situations where that control is needed. For example, you could use this
  property to "intercept" the patches that are about to be applied to your
  component while re-rendering, and, for an example, forbid the removal of
  attributes by deleting all patches with *"removeAttribute"*. This is in the
  format of an Array. Each item in the Array is itself a 4-Array (Array of
  length 4), in the following format: `[element, method, arg1, arg2]`.  For
  example, to do a *"removeAttribute"* patch on an "id" attribute for a given
  "target element" (a real DOM node on the page somewhere), it might be `[(ref
  to "target element"), "removeAttribute", "id", undefined]` If the Array is
  empty, then no patches will be applied.


## attrs

Components use their attributes to set several configuration options.
They take the following attributes:


### name

`name` - *REQUIRED* - The "name" of the component.  Conventionally, it should
be written in camel or dromedary case, like how class names are written in
JavaScript: `LikeThis`.  Technically, it's case insensitive, so a component
named like `LikeThis`, imported with an `x-` namespace, could also be used like
`x-likethis` or `X-LIKETHIS`.


### rerender

`rerender` - *default is `rerender="event"`*.  Specify mode to change the
render mode of this component.  A detailed discussion of valid options are
below:

* `rerender="event"` - The default behavior, where the the component will
   rerender after ever event it handles (e.g. after every user interaction).
   This is typically desirable since usually every user interaction will cause
   some visual change that needs to be reflected.
* `rerender="manual"` - Modulo will not auto-rerender in any situation.  This
  Note that if this is set, you will have to manually rerender, such as in a
  *Script* CPart (`element.rerender()`), or in a custom CPart
  (`this.element.rerender()`) is invoked. This is useful if there are many
  events that don't cause changes (e.g. mouse movement), but you have
  discovered that the extra rerender invocations are impacting performance,
  even though they aren't generating patches to modify the DOM.



### mode

`mode` - *default is `mode="regular"`*.  Specify mode to change the DOM root
render mode of this component. This changes what is considered to be the root
of the element, and thus where the content of the Template goes during
reconciliation. In "regular" and "vanish", it's the custom component itself
(which will be removed after rendering with "vanish"), in "shadow", it uses an
attached shadow DOM as the root, and with "vanish-into-document" it replaces
the entire page.  This allows you to isolate outside CSS from your component
using "shadow", do one-time renders only with "vanish", or make your component
replace the entire document with "vanish-into-document". A detailed discussion
of valid options are below:
* `mode="regular"` - The default behavior, where the content generated by this
  the element will be attached to the regular DOM, as the element itself. This
  means that CSS stylesheets attached the normal way (e.g. with a "link" tag)
  will affect the contents of this component. *Style* CParts are, however,
  automatically scoped to the component, so a selector like `p {...}` will
  get prefixed like `x-MyComp {...}` when CSS files are being
  generated from *Style* CParts. Keep in mind the normal CSS rules will still
  apply, meaning that auto-scoped "p" tag will also affect children,
  grandchildren, etc of sub-components (unless those are "shadow" based).

* `mode="shadow"` - Use the so-called "shadow DOM" to render the content
  generated by this component. While the *shadow DOM* may sound like a sci-fi
  villain, it's a mechanism browsers provide for custom elements to isolate
  their contents from CSS selectors or other JavaScript libraries. This
  isolation means means that CSS stylesheets attached the normal way (e.g. with
  a "link" tag) *will not* affect the contents of this element. Note that other
  than the isolation provided, the shadow mode should work exactly the same as
  regular. That said, *Style* CParts will still be automatically scoped to the
  component, but will use the shadowDOM feature to more strictly enforce that
  scoping. Note that shadowDOM CSS will *not* get included in the CSS file
  bundle, but instead will be bundled in the JavaScript source code. For a
  component by itself, switching from "shadow" to "regular" or vice-versa
  shouldn't change behavior at all. It's only useful when CSS from one
  component or a third party CSS library is "getting inside" your other
  components in an undesirable way, and you want to isolate them.

* `mode="vanish"` - This less-used setting causes the component to "vanish"
  after rendering, or replace itself with it's children. Setting this will
  cause the component to remove itself after the first time it renders,
  effectively using the component as a simple template. All CParts will become
  useless after the first rendering, so CParts like *Script* or *State* are
  rarely useful in combination with this mode. This "one-time render" feature
  is most useful for static pages when you don't want your custom components to
  get in the way of the DOM that is generated, and for creating static-site
  generators, when you just want to generate plain HTML, with no Modulo JS or
  behavior in the end.

* `mode="vanish-into-document"` - This setting is useful in one situation: When
  you want to create a "page" level component that changes tags that belong in
  the document head, such as `&lt;title&gt;`. Like with `mode="vanish"`
  described above, setting this will cause the component to remove itself after
  the first time it renders. However, with vanish-into-document, it will
  instead replace the entire page.  It will also attempt to correctly insert
  all tags that belong in the document head (meta, title, link, script to be
  specific), causing link and script tags alike (e.g.  `&lt;script
  src=".."&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`) to load.  Finally, the document will be wiped,
  and anything else it finds will be put directly into the document's body, for
  a clean DOM structure that removes itself entirely during this "one-time
  render".

* `mode="custom-root"` - This is rarely useful, but allows for setting some
  other DOM element as the new root element for the component to target for
  rendering it's content. This is done by assigning a value to
  `renderObj.component.root` before reconciliation. If no `.root` value is set,
  an error will occur.


## Directives

The *Component* defines 3 directives:

* `[component.event]` (*shortcut:* `@`) -
Attach event listeners to DOM elements, and remove them when the DOM
elements are removed. (For jQuery users, this is used for similar purposes
as "live" (delegated) events, but is faster.)</li>

* `[component.dataProp]` (*shortcut:* `:`) -
Attach data to a DOM element's `.dataProp` object, which can be
used to directly pass `renderObj` values as *Props* or
events</li>

* `[component.slot]` - Reattach the original child elements that this component
  had when it was first mounted to a new DOM element.  (For React users, this
  is similar to doing `{this.props.children}`.) This can be used in addition to
  or instead of the `&lt;slot&gt;` interface. For more on the slot interface,
  see Mozilla's
  [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot](The Web
  Component Slot element).  Note that Modulo uses this interface for
  both `mode="shadow"` (e.g. using `shadowRoot` as the root element for
  reconciliation) and all the other DOM rendering modes (e.g.
  `mode="regular"`, `mode="vanish-into-document"`). For Shadow DOM, it will
  fall-back on Browser behavior. For everything else, it will detach any nodes
  it finds and reattach the nodes just before the beginning of the
  reconciliation process (it's DOM load-directive).



# Configuration


Use a Configuration definition to configure Modulo at the global level, or
extend Modulo's functionality with JavaScript.


For example, suppose you wanted to configure Modulo to allow Components and
Libraries to be defined "loose" within the head of an HTML document, along with
the Modulo definition.  Here is an example of setting the
`modulo.config.domloader.topLevelTags` configuration attribute to do so:

```
<Configuration
    domloader.top-level-tags:=&apos;["component", "library", "modulo"]&apos;
></Configuration>
```


Configuration can also be used as a script tag for more fine-grained
control. This will only be run once, within an isolated context, so temporary
variables are discarded.


```
<script Configuration>
    modulo.config.domloader.topLevelTags.push("library");
    modulo.config.domloader.topLevelTags.push("component");
    var myVar = "stuff"; // Note: not global
/script>
```


Configuration's use as a Script tag becomes useful for integrating third
party libraries, as a sort of simple module and adapter system. Examine the
following for a complete example of registering the "snarkdown" module from NPM
as a templateFilter, allowing it to be used by components as a filter in the
HTML Templates:

```
<script Configuration -src="https://unpkg.com/snarkdown">
    modulo.register("templateFilter", snarkdown);
/script>
<Component name="HelloWorld">
    <Template>
        <textarea [state.bind] name="text"></textarea>
        <div>{{ state.text|snarkdown|safe }}</div>
    </Template>
    <State
        text="Hello *markdown* _world_"
    ></State>
    <Style>:host { display: flex; }</Style>
</Component>
```

## Integrating analytics

If you have some custom analytics script to integrate, it can be done this way.
Examine the following snippet that was taken from the Fathom Lite
mini-analytics software:


```
<!-- Setup Fathom -->
<script Configuration>
     function setupFathom(code) {
        const host = window.location.host;
        // Check common things we skip -- ensure doesn't trigger during builds
        if (host.startsWith('localhost') ||
                host.includes('.local') ||
                host.startsWith('127') ||
                host.startsWith('192') ||
                host.startsWith('dev--'))  {
            return;
        }
        (function(f, a, t, h, o, m){
            a[h]=a[h]||function(){
                (a[h].q=a[h].q||[]).push(arguments)
            };
            o=f.createElement('script'),
            m=f.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
            o.async=1; o.src=t; o.id='fathom-script';
            m.parentNode.insertBefore(o,m)
        })(document, window, '//ZZ.XXXXXXXX.YYY/tracker.js', 'fathom');
        fathom('set', 'siteId', code);
        fathom('trackPageview');
    }
    setupFathom('XXXXX');
/script>
```

*(Note that `ZZ.XXXXXXXX.YYY` would be replaced with a real domain)*


# Library

Use a Library to share Component "Library files" between components. The
most typical usage is in conjunction with `-src` and
`namespace`, as below:


```
<Library
    namespace="mylib"
    -src="./static/libraries/mylib.html"
></Library>
```

## attrs

Libraries use their attributes to configure the Components that they load.
That means their attributes are the same as the Component class attributes,
except they are "applied" across all child components. This means you can
configure *any* configuration option on Components. However, you typically
only want to set *namespace*, and possibly *mode*.

* `namespace` - 
    - default: `namespace="x"`
    - The namespace prefix that goes before the component when registering on
      the DOM. This is the most common thing you will set on a Library, since
      it allows you to "namespace" or isolate the components that you load and
      prevent names from conflicting. For example, you can import two
      Libraries, each with a `name="Modal"` component, but by giving them
      separate namespaces, you can distinguish them with something like
      `lib1-Modal` and `lib2-Modal`, instead of `x-Modal` for both, which would
      get confusing.

* `mode`
    - Override the default mode of loaded components.
    - You can use this to force a _Library_ to have vanishing components
      (`mode="vanish"`), or have components that isolate their style
      (`mode="shadow"`).
    - Note that if you are loading somebody else's component library and
      overriding the component modes with this attribute, it may not work
      correctly (or at all!), since many components may require they stay on
      the page after rendering for the JavaScript and other functionality to
      work. However, some components may work either way, allowing a
      lighter-weight usage with "vanish", a style-isolated version with
      "shadow", or an interactive, non-isolated version as default.




# Modulo

This is the "launching off point" or starting point of all Modulo projects
and Modulo code. The "Modulo" definition is what then contains Components,
Libraries, and others.


Modulo.js, while in "dev" mode (e.g. not the "built" version), will by
default search for a *Modulo* definition in a few different places:

1. *child of head* - Defined already in the head (NOT
    nested in any tags) by the time the Script tag appears. It will read it
    synchronously, meaning synchronous tags will be registered immediately
    after loading the src="Modulo.js", blocking, inline with page load.
    This is the default way that embedded Modulo projects work, such as when
    you start with a blank file and paste in a Modulo snippet. Note that
    embedded (NOT using `-src=`) core definition scripts (such as
    *Configuration*) will be run synchronously and blocking while the
    page is loading, possibly with the document open for writing.

2. *child of body* - Defined in the body at the top level
    (NOT nested in any tags).  Modulo.js will read it asynchronously after the DOM has
    finished parsing (the `DOMContentLoaded` event). This will
    happen if your `src="Modulo.js"` tag is in the body of a normally formed HTML
    page, or is loaded asynchronously or after the document has finished
    writing. Component registration will not be synchronous or blocking.

## Example

### Using a bare "Modulo" tag:

Note that this is only good if it is NOT being embedded in an HTML document,
or if you are sure that it will not need any more complexity than this (simply
because things like Script tags and Style tags will not function correctly in
this situation, as they will get executed when the page loads causing "leakage").

```
<Modulo>
    <Configuration -src="./my-config-script.js"></Configuration>
    <Component name="HelloWorld">
        <Template>
            Hello *Modulo* World!
        </Template>
    </Component>
    <Library -src="./mylib.html"></Library>
</Modulo>
```



### As a "template" tag, for embedding:

```
<template Modulo>
    <Configuration -src="./my-config-script.js"></Configuration>
    <Component name="HelloWorld">
        <Template>
            Hello <strong>Modulo</strong> World!
        </Template>
    </Component>
    <Library -src="./mylib.html"></Library>
</template>
```

### Condensed "script" tag:

This example is in a single Script tag that also loads Modulo JS code (in
this case, using the unpkg CDN). It is ideal if you put all of your Modulo code
in another HTML file anyway (in this case, `/static/index.html`),
thus making a simple "4-liner" boilerplate for any page that needs your Modulo
component libraries:

```
<script Modulo
    src="//unpkg.com/mdu.js"
    -src="/static/"
>/script>
```
