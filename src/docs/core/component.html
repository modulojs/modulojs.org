# Component

> **Low-level interface** - Component developers will typically
only need to use the `name="..."` attribute on *Component*,
and sometimes `mode="vanish-into-document"` for  page-level
components. Similarly, none of the `renderObj.component` properties
are typically useful for component developers. Instead, they are used
internally by CParts (notably *Template*) in order to move along the
rendering cycle.

The *Component* definition is the most central to Modulo. It's how we register
components to be mounted on the page, and define the CParts that go inside
those Components. It's also what stitches together the "machinery" that makes
reconciliation and rendering even possible. In other words, the *Component*  is
what handles the "low-level" operations of mounting, reconciling to generate
patches, and applying those patches to rerender, and the interface described
here allows for low-level manipulation of this process for unusual
circumstances when it's needed.


## renderObj

The Component reads several properties from the `renderObj`, at different
lifecycle phases. Read below on how to interface with it.


* `component.originalHTML` - *Read-only* - This contains the
  initial HTML that the element had when mounted on the page.

* `component.innerHTML` - *Write-only* -
Assign to this to cause the *Component* to attempt to
reconcile the current HTML with the target HTML provided.
It functions a little bit like HTML's built-in *"element.innerHTML"*:
Assign a string containing HTML code to this property to see the HTML
appear on the page. This is what the *Template* does behind
the scenes. Unlike HTML's built-in *"element.innerHTML"*, assigning
to this renderObj property will not cause an full update, overwriting
everything that exists, but instead will cause the *Component* to
employ the "reconciler" specified to generate a patches list (see next). By
default, it will then also apply those patches in the `update`
lifecycle.

* `component.patches` - Between the `reconcile` and `update` stages, the
  "patches" property is exposed to allow access to or modification of the
  patches that the Component intends to apply. This is an advanced feature that
  gives fine-grained control to how rendering works, and thus is only useful in
  rare situations where that control is needed. For example, you could use this
  property to "intercept" the patches that are about to be applied to your
  component while re-rendering, and, for an example, forbid the removal of
  attributes by deleting all patches with *"removeAttribute"*. This is in the
  format of an Array. Each item in the Array is itself a 4-Array (Array of
  length 4), in the following format: `[element, method, arg1, arg2]`.  For
  example, to do a *"removeAttribute"* patch on an "id" attribute for a given
  "target element" (a real DOM node on the page somewhere), it might be `[(ref
  to "target element"), "removeAttribute", "id", undefined]` If the Array is
  empty, then no patches will be applied.


### Examples of patches

Using `console.table(component.patches);`, you can easily inspect the
exact order of DOM operations that Modulo will do for every operation.
This produces useful results in both Firefox and Chromium-based browsers.

```modulo_demo
<Template>
    <label><input [state.bind] name="enabled" type="checkbox" /> Show patches in Developer Console</label> <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>To Do example:</h3>
    <ol>{% for item in state.list %} <li>{{ item }}</li> {% endfor %}</ol>
    <p>
        <input [state.bind] name="text" />
        <button @click:=state.list.push payload="{{ state.text }}">+</button>
    </p>
</Template>
<State
    num:=42
    enabled:=false
    list:='["Milk", "Bread", "Candy"]'
    text="Coffee"
></State>
<Script>
    function updateCallback() {
        if (state.enabled) {
            console.table(component.patches);
        }
    }
    function countUp() {
        state.num++;
    }
/Script>
```


## attrs

Components use their attributes to set several configuration options.
They take the following attributes:


### name

`name` - *REQUIRED* - The "name" of the component.  Conventionally, it should
be written in camel or dromedary case, like how class names are written in
JavaScript: `LikeThis`.  Technically, it's case insensitive, so a component
named like `LikeThis`, imported with an `x-` namespace, could also be used like
`x-likethis` or `X-LIKETHIS`.


### rerender

`rerender` - *default is `rerender="event"`*.  Specify mode to change the
render mode of this component.  A detailed discussion of valid options are
below:

* `rerender="event"` - The default behavior, where the the component will
   rerender after ever event it handles (e.g. after every user interaction).
   This is typically desirable since usually every user interaction will cause
   some visual change that needs to be reflected.
* `rerender="manual"` - Modulo will not auto-rerender in any situation.  This
  Note that if this is set, you will have to manually rerender, such as in a
  *Script* CPart (`element.rerender()`), or in a custom CPart
  (`this.element.rerender()`) is invoked. This is useful if there are many
  events that don't cause changes (e.g. mouse movement), but you have
  discovered that the extra rerender invocations are impacting performance,
  even though they aren't generating patches to modify the DOM.



### mode

`mode` - *default is `mode="regular"`*.  Specify mode to change the DOM root
render mode of this component. This changes what is considered to be the root
of the element, and thus where the content of the Template goes during
reconciliation. In "regular" and "vanish", it's the custom component itself
(which will be removed after rendering with "vanish"), in "shadow", it uses an
attached shadow DOM as the root, and with "vanish-into-document" it replaces
the entire page.  This allows you to isolate outside CSS from your component
using "shadow", do one-time renders only with "vanish", or make your component
replace the entire document with "vanish-into-document". A detailed discussion
of valid options are below:
* `mode="regular"` - The default behavior, where the content generated by this
  the element will be attached to the regular DOM, as the element itself. This
  means that CSS stylesheets attached the normal way (e.g. with a "link" tag)
  will affect the contents of this component. *Style* CParts are, however,
  automatically scoped to the component, so a selector like `p {...}` will
  get prefixed like `x-MyComp {...}` when CSS files are being
  generated from *Style* CParts. Keep in mind the normal CSS rules will still
  apply, meaning that auto-scoped "p" tag will also affect children,
  grandchildren, etc of sub-components (unless those are "shadow" based).

* `mode="shadow"` - Use the so-called "shadow DOM" to render the content
  generated by this component. While the *shadow DOM* may sound like a sci-fi
  villain, it's a mechanism browsers provide for custom elements to isolate
  their contents from CSS selectors or other JavaScript libraries. This
  isolation means means that CSS stylesheets attached the normal way (e.g. with
  a "link" tag) *will not* affect the contents of this element. Note that other
  than the isolation provided, the shadow mode should work exactly the same as
  regular. That said, *Style* CParts will still be automatically scoped to the
  component, but will use the shadowDOM feature to more strictly enforce that
  scoping. Note that shadowDOM CSS will *not* get included in the CSS file
  bundle, but instead will be bundled in the JavaScript source code. For a
  component by itself, switching from "shadow" to "regular" or vice-versa
  shouldn't change behavior at all. It's only useful when CSS from one
  component or a third party CSS library is "getting inside" your other
  components in an undesirable way, and you want to isolate them.

* `mode="vanish"` - This less-used setting causes the component to "vanish"
  after rendering, or replace itself with it's children. Setting this will
  cause the component to remove itself after the first time it renders,
  effectively using the component as a simple template. All CParts will become
  useless after the first rendering, so CParts like *Script* or *State* are
  rarely useful in combination with this mode. This "one-time render" feature
  is most useful for static pages when you don't want your custom components to
  get in the way of the DOM that is generated, and for creating static-site
  generators, when you just want to generate plain HTML, with no Modulo JS or
  behavior in the end.

* `mode="vanish-into-document"` - This setting is useful in one situation: When
  you want to create a "page" level component that changes tags that belong in
  the document head, such as `&lt;title&gt;`. Like with `mode="vanish"`
  described above, setting this will cause the component to remove itself after
  the first time it renders. However, with vanish-into-document, it will
  instead replace the entire page.  It will also attempt to correctly insert
  all tags that belong in the document head (meta, title, link, script to be
  specific), causing link and script tags alike (e.g.  `&lt;script
  src=".."&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`) to load.  Finally, the document will be wiped,
  and anything else it finds will be put directly into the document's body, for
  a clean DOM structure that removes itself entirely during this "one-time
  render".

* `mode="custom-root"` - This is rarely useful, but allows for setting some
  other DOM element as the new root element for the component to target for
  rendering it's content. This is done by assigning a value to
  `renderObj.component.root` before reconciliation. If no `.root` value is set,
  an error will occur.


## Directives

The *Component* defines 3 directives:

* `[component.event]` (*shortcut:* `@`) -
Attach event listeners to DOM elements, and remove them when the DOM
elements are removed. (For jQuery users, this is used for similar purposes
as "live" (delegated) events, but is faster.)</li>

* `[component.dataProp]` (*shortcut:* `:`) -
Attach data to a DOM element's `.dataProp` object, which can be
used to directly pass `renderObj` values as *Props* or
events</li>


## Slots

Reattach the original child elements that this component had when it was first
mounted to a new DOM element.  (For React users, this is similar to doing
`{this.props.children}`.)  For more on the slot interface, see Mozilla's
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot](The Web
Component Slot element).  Note that Modulo uses this interface for both
`mode="shadow"` (e.g. using `shadowRoot` as the root element for
reconciliation) and all the other DOM rendering modes (e.g.  `mode="regular"`,
`mode="vanish-into-document"`). For Shadow DOM, it will fall-back on Browser
behavior. For everything else, it will detach any nodes it finds and reattach
the nodes just before the beginning of the reconciliation process (it's DOM
load-directive).
