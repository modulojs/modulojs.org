# Include


Use a _Include_ definition to add in _script_, _link_, _meta_, or _head_
dependencies.

### Example 1: For script and link dependencies

The simplest way to use `Include` is as a global definition. It will "include"
it's contents in the head of the document  as soon as Modulo loads. Note that
it will NEVER include the same thing twice (it uses hashes to identify
resources).  This mode is great for following tutorials for integrating JS
projects. 

For example, to include Quill JS, it's as easy as just pasting in the head
content they give you:

```
<Include>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quill@2.0.3/dist/quill.snow.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quill@2.0.3/dist/quill.js">/script>
</Include>
```



### Example 2: Including meta content

_Include_ can be used for adding meta tags to your page as well:

```
<Include>
    <meta name="description" content="A great Modulo website" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="charset" charset="utf8" />
</Include>
```
