# Core Definitions

Core definitions can be placed at the top level of Modulo code. That is to say,
the definitions listed here (Artifact, Component, Configuration, and Library)
can all be defined at the top level of file loaded by *Modulo* or
Library, or embedded directly within a Modulo tag in the `<head>` of the
document. Typically, documentation on this page is most useful when you want to
dig into configuring Modulo to behave a certain way across multiple pages, or
interacting with other frameworks and versions.

> **Which ones to use?** Most users of Modulo will use the _Component_
> definition the most. The other definitions listed here are useful most when
> you want to extend Modulo with custom JavaScript behavior, or integrate with
> third party code.

## The outermost core definition

The outermost definition is always Modulo -- this is what "kicks off" the
entire project. This is  the `<script Modulo ...` or the `<template Modulo>`
you might see at the top of a Modulo project.

- See the ["Modulo" core definition page](modulo.html) for information on
  the top-level _Modulo_ definition and the various options for embedding


## The next core definitions

After that, most Modulo projects will have one or more of the following
definitions, along with a summary of each:


1.  [Configuration](configuration.html) - *(Extending or configuring Modulo and
including third-party JavaScript libraries)*
2.  [Library](library.html) - *(Importing component libraries with
non-conflicting namespaces or aliases)*
3.  [Artifact](artifact.html) - *(Customizing build behavior or specifying
additional build artifacts)*
4.  [Component](component.html) - *(Registering web components, each in turn
comprising of a collection of component parts)*


Conventionally, they are typically listed in the order supplied above, although
in some situations you might find it necessary to change the ordering because
of sepcific needs, since Modulo processes definitions from top-to-bottom (e.g.,
the `Configuration` tags behave much like how the browser processes `<script>`
tags in an HTML document).
