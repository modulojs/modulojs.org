# Library

Use a Library to share Component "Library files" between components. The most
typical usage is in conjunction with `-src` and `namespace`, as below:


```
<Library
    namespace="mylib"
    -src="./static/libraries/mylib.html"
></Library>
```

## attrs

Libraries use their attributes to configure the Components that they load.
That means their attributes are the same as the Component class attributes,
except they are "applied" across all child components. This means you can
configure *any* configuration option on Components. However, you typically
only want to set *namespace*, and possibly *mode*.

* `namespace` - 
    - default: `namespace="x"`
    - The namespace prefix that goes before the component when registering on
      the DOM. This is the most common thing you will set on a Library, since
      it allows you to "namespace" or isolate the components that you load and
      prevent names from conflicting. For example, you can import two
      Libraries, each with a `name="Modal"` component, but by giving them
      separate namespaces, you can distinguish them with something like
      `lib1-Modal` and `lib2-Modal`, instead of `x-Modal` for both, which would
      get confusing.

* `mode`
    - Override the default mode of loaded components.
    - You can use this to force a _Library_ to have vanishing components
      (`mode="vanish"`), or have components that isolate their style
      (`mode="shadow"`).
    - Note that if you are loading somebody else's component library and
      overriding the component modes with this attribute, it may not work
      correctly (or at all!), since many components may require they stay on
      the page after rendering for the JavaScript and other functionality to
      work. However, some components may work either way, allowing a
      lighter-weight usage with "vanish", a style-isolated version with
      "shadow", or an interactive, non-isolated version as default.


* `alias`
    - default: (none)
    - Override the default alias of loaded components
    - This allows you to give the components a "nick-name" that you then refer
      to them as in your _Template_
    - If `alias` is specified while `namespace` left blank, the components will
      get an auto-generated and unique namespace based on on the full
      definition name of the component
    - When your templates compile, they will swap the tags for the nick-name,
      allowing you to have easily remembered local names for imported
      Library components, but the final component will have a long, unique tag
      name (and all that will be "baked in" to the final compiled template
